We conducted a narrative review aiming to identify examples of COIs in IPC research. In addition to well-known instances, we conducted PubMed and Google searches to identify and report case studies of COIs in IPC and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which were chosen arbitrarily following consensus meetings, to illustrate different types of COIs. We also searched the Retraction Watch database and blog to systematically identify retracted IPC and/or infectious disease-related papers. Our review highlights COIs in academic research linked to ties between industry and physicians, journal editors, peer-reviewed journals' choice for publication, and guideline committees participants and authors. It explores how COIs can affect research and could be managed. We also present several selected case studies that involve (1) the chlorhexidine industry and how it has used marketing trials and key opinion leaders to promote off-label use of its products; (2) the copper industry and how reporting of its trials in IPC have furthered their agenda; (3) the influence of a company developing \"closed infusion systems\" for catheters and how this affects networks in low- and middle-income countries and guideline development; (4) potential perverse incentives hospitals may have in reporting healthcare-associated infection or AMR rates and how government intervention may restrict AMR research for fear of bad publicity and subsequent negative economic consequences. Finally, the analysis of reasons for the retraction of previously published papers highlights the fact that misconduct in research may have other motivations than financial gain, the most visible form of COIs. COIs occur in the field of research in general, and IPC and AMR are no exceptions. Their effects pervade all aspects of the research and publication processes.

In this paper, we elucidate whether author bias can be detected in a cohort of randomized trials included in a meta-analysis. METHODS: We utilized mortality data from 35 trials (10,880 patients) included in our previously published meta-analysis. First, we linked each author with their trial (or trials). Then we calculated author-specific odds ratios using univariate cross table methods. Finally, we tested the effect of authorship by comparing each author's estimated odds ratio with all other pooled estimated odds ratios using meta-regression. RESULTS: The median number of investigators named as authors on the primary trial reports was six (interquartile range: 5-8, range: 2-32). The results showed that the slope of author effect for mortality ranged from - 1.35 to 0.71. We identified only one author team showing a marginally significant effect (- 0.39; 95% confidence interval, - 0.78 to 0.00). This author team has a history of retractions due to data manipulations and ethical violations. CONCLUSION: When combining trial-level data to produce a pooled effect estimate, investigators must consider sources of potential bias. Our results suggest that systematic errors can be detected using meta-regression, although further research is needed to examine the sensitivity of this model. Systematic reviewers will benefit from the availability of methods to guard against the dissemination of results with the potential to mislead decision-making.", "Comments": "= Journal canadien d'anesthesie\n\"The objective of this study was to determine whether meta-regression can be used to identify author bias in a cohort of published trials that includes an author subsequently subject to retraction for misconduct.\"", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1007/s12630-018-01268-6 ", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Abou-Setta Ahmed M, Rabbani Rasheda, Lix Lisa M, Turgeon Alexis F, Houston Brett L, Fergusson Dean A, and Zarychanski Ryan (2019) Can authorship bias be detected in meta-analysis?.

Studies of the number of article retractions use retraction percentages to perpetuate the idea that research misconduct is not a common event, and use information in the retraction notice to quantify types of research misconduct and types or research error. However, retractions appear to be the wrong variable with which to assess misconduct rates and characteristics. Using final misconduct findings in hard science research from the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) for investigations closed from 1993 through 2013, the number of publications and subsequent retractions or corrections per final ORI finding was analyzed. Out of 167 subjects who received ORI sanctions, 84 (50.3%) had no publications associated with their misconduct. Of the remaining 83 subjects, only 72 had at least one retraction associated with their misconduct, i.e., only 43.1% of the all study subjects sanctioned for misconduct had at least one retraction from misconduct. Of the 231 retractions and corrections arising from the sanctioned misconduct, only 94 notices (40.7%) gave research misconduct as a cause for the retraction or correction. Thus, the study demonstrates that research misconduct occurs at a greater rate than retractions for misconduct are published, and retraction and correction notices cannot be relied upon to convey the presence of fraudulent data within the publication.", "Comments": "Chapter 3 - study of retractions associated with ORI misconduct findings", "ParentAuthors": "", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Abritis Alison J (2015) An Assessment of Retractions as a Measure of Scientific Misconduct and Impact on Public Health Risks. , University of South Florida.", "type": "Publication", "Link": "https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/etd/5630/", "label": "An Assessment of Retractions as a Measure of Scientific Misconduct and Impact on Public Health Risks", "author": ["Abritis Alison J"], "id": 37275828, "pub-type": "Dissertation", "year": "2015", "Authorship_of_retracted_papers": ["Characteristics of authors of retracted papers", "Analysis of repeat offenses"], "Visibility_of_retraction_status": "Visibility/accessibility of retraction status/RETRACTION NOTICES", "Database_search_limitations": "Database source--start date limitation (not from database inception)", "Processes_and_policies": "Analysis of reasons for retraction", "Characteristics_of_retracted_papers": "Retracted papers--impact factor and related metrics of journals", "Studies_performing_analyses_and_actions_to_identify_and_report_problems_in_the_literature": "Analyzing retraction status of items formally identified in research misconduct inquiries and investigations", "Language": "English"}, {"Codes": [{"AttributeId": 9095044, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095037, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095042, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9564478, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}], "Outcomes": [], "ShortTitle": "Achsan (2019)", "DateCreated": "10/02/2021", "CreatedBy": "Katherine Howell", "DateEdited": "02/07/2021", "EditedBy": "Katherine Howell", "Month": "", "StandardNumber": "9781728155296 (ISBN)", "City": "", "Country": "", "Publisher": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.", "Institution": "", "Volume": "", "Pages": "148-153.", "Edition": "", "Issue": "", "Availability": "", "URL": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083593299&doi=10.1109%2fIC3I46837.2019.9055651&partnerID=40&md5=e5166fd2377c46bc6487c9b4441435b2", "OldItemId": "", "Abstract": "Many document indexing has been developed since the emergence of the Internet for local, regional, or global authors. Some local document indexing has also been developed for Indonesian authors like Garuda, Neliti, IPI (Indonesian Publication Index), and Sinta (Indonesian Science and Technology Index). The most phenomenal among Indonesian document indexing is Sinta because it is used to score authors that are taken into account when the researcher apply for research grants and promotion. It is also to rank authors, institutions, and journals. Unfortunately, there was no research about Sinta to convince authors that Sinta database is reliable. The purposes of this research are to propose a technique to evaluate document indexing services such as Sinta and to propose some improvements. We used focused web crawler for data gathering. The data then processed by using bibliometrics and information retrievals methods. The results show that there were noises in Sinta's database like duplicate accounts, foreign authors, foreign articles, invalid Scopus articles, difference citation count, and retracted corrigendum articles. This research also revealed a side effect of Sinta that is unethical ways of publication by Indonesian authors.

However, there was no similar evaluation of errata in the field of neurosurgical literature. The aim of this study is to evaluate published errata in neurosurgical journals and to discuss the strategies that can be used in order to reduce errata frequency and to prevent their dissemination. Methods: A literature search of error publication in 28 main neurosurgical journals was performed using PubMed (1990\u20132019). Extracted data included authors\u2019 name, chronology, country of origin, journal impact factor, subject area, research type, reason for published error, and source of responsibility. Results: A total of 441 published errata were identified and analyzed. Most studies were published within the last 6 years. The majority of publications had one single reason for the published erratum. The mean amount of time between the original publication date of the paper and the published erratum was 6.72 months. The most common reason given for published erratum was that of authorship, followed by text content, figures, and tables. The mean published error rate was 0.81% (2014\u20132019). Conclusion: Unlike other specialties, errors are infrequently observed in neurosurgical journals and mostly without altering the interpretation of study findings. However, improvement is still needed.

Papers are retracted because of scientific misconduct or serious error. To date there have been no studies that have examined rates of retraction in nursing and midwifery journals. Design: A systematic review of Journal Citation Report listed nursing science journals. Data sources: The Medline database was searched systematically from January 1980 through July 2017, and www.retractionwatch.com was manually searched for relevant studies that met the inclusion criteria. Review methods: Two researchers undertook title and abstract and full text screening. Data were extracted on the country of the corresponding author, journal title, impact factor, study design, year of retraction, number of citations after retraction, and reason for retraction. Journals retraction index was also calculated. Results: Twenty-nine retracted papers published in nursing science journals were identified, the first in 2007. This represents 0.029% of all papers published in these journals since 2007. We observed a significant increase in the retraction rate of 0.44 per 10,000 publications per year (95% CI; 0.03\u20130.84, p =.037). There was a negative association between a journal's retraction index and impact factor with a significant reduction in retraction index of \u22120.57 for a one-point increase in impact factor (95% CI; \u22121.05 to \u22120.09, p =.022). Duplicate publication was the most common reason for retraction (n = 18, 58%). The mean number of citations manuscripts received after retraction was seven, the highest was 52. Most (n = 27, 93.1%) of the retracted papers are still available online (with a watermark indicating they are retracted). Conclusion: Compared to more established academic disciplines, rates of retraction in nursing and midwifery are low. Findings suggest that unsound research is not being identified and that the checks and balances incumbent in the scientific method are not working. In a clinical discipline, this is concerning and may indicate that research that should have been removed from the evidence base continues to influence nursing and midwifery care. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd", "Comments": "Cited By :6 | Export Date: 21 April 2020", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2018.01.013", "Keywords": "Journal citation reports\r\nMidwifery\r\nNursing\r\nRemoval\r\nResearch integrity\r\nRetraction\r\nRetractions\r\nSystematic review\r\nWithdraw\r\nhuman\r\nMedline\r\nmidwife\r\nnursing science\r\npublishing\r\nreview\r\nscientist\r\nstudy design\r\nsystematic review\r\njournal impact factor\r\nnursing research\r\npublishing\r\nHumans\r\nJournal Impact Factor\r\nMidwifery\r\nNursing Research\r\nRetraction of Publication as Topic", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Al-Ghareeb Amal, Hillel Stav, McKenna Lisa, Cleary Michelle, Visentin Denis, Jones Martin, Bressington Daniel, and Gray Richard (2018) Retraction of publications in nursing and midwifery research: a systematic review.

LILACS has a similar geographical coverage and includes dissertations and conference/symposia proceedings, but it is limited to publications in the health sciences. A search for retraction notices was performed in these two databases using the keywords \"retracted\", \"retraction\" \"withdrawal\", \"withdrawn\", \"removed\" and \"redress\". Documents were manually checked to identify those that actually referred to retractions, which were then analyzed and categorized according to the reasons alleged in the notices. Dates of publication/retraction and time to retraction were also recorded. Searching procedures were performed between June and December 2014. Thirty-one retraction notices were identified, fifteen of which were in JCR-indexed journals. \"Plagiarism\" was alleged in six retractions of this group. Among the non-JCR journals, retraction reasons were alleged in fourteen cases, twelve of which were attributed to \"plagiarism\". The proportion of retracted articles for the SciELO database was approximately 0.005 %. The reasons alleged in retraction notices may be used as signposts to inform discussions in Latin America on plagiarism and research integrity.

The topic, however, remains neglected in the field of tourism and hospitality. The current investigation explores the current level of retraction in tourism and hospitality research. It also draws on the perceptions of the editors-in-chief of tourism and hospitality journals to understand their attitudes toward retraction. The findings reveal that retraction is quite rare in the field of tourism and hospitality (only 5 retracted articles were identified). Empirical evidence shows that editors-in-chief have mixed perceptions concerning the current level of retraction, varying between optimism and pessimism. Optimistic editors-in-chief agreed that the rareness of retraction is reflective of research integrity and identified awareness of the best practices in academic publishing, the youthfulness of tourism as an area of study, and the role of plagiarism detection software programs as significant factors. Pessimistic editors-in-chief were reluctant to consider the low retraction rate to be an indicator of a high level of research integrity and they highlighted the difficulty of detecting malpractice, editors-in-chief's unwillingness to engage in retraction, and the existence of unethical practices that do not lead to retraction. By identifying the retraction level and exploring the perceptions of editors-in-chief, the present study endeavours to track the progress, transparency, and integrity of tourism and hospitality research.", "Comments": "\"An earlier version of this paper was presented at the Second International Congress on Future of Tourism: Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Sustainability (Futourism 2018) in Mersin-Turkey, September 2018.\"", "ParentAuthors": "", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Alrawadieh Zaid, and Zareer Ahmed (2019) Exploring retraction in tourism and hospitality journals.

Method: Papers in which the first author was affiliated to an Arabian country were selected from the Retraction Watch database covering the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2018. The retrieved records were divided into nine categories based on the reasons for retraction. Results: The search yielded 322 retractions, and the most frequent reason for retraction was plagiarism (34.5%). The median time from publication to retraction was 14 (25%-75% percentile 5-30) months. The number of papers retracted each year as well as the number of papers published in a given year but subsequently retracted increased steadily over the 21 years. The proportion of retracted papers to the total number of published papers (0.17%) was higher than the global proportion and was the highest for Algeria (1%) and the lowest for Lebanon (0.03%). Of the countries within the Arab region, 12 out of 14 countries showed either plagiarism or duplication as the most common reason for retraction; however, the countries differed in terms of the number of retractions and the time from publishing to retraction. Conclusion: Plagiarism was the most common cause of retraction in the Arab countries. The increase in the number of papers retracted each year was probably because searches now extend farther in the past, whereas the increase in the number of papers published in a given year but subsequently retracted can be attributed to the overall increase in the number of papers published. \u00a9 2020, European Association of Science Editors.

We enquire about the relationship between these personality and fatal disease papers and the wider body of Eysenck's work. Our analysis revealed that these papers are part of a research topic that stands apart from his many other seminal contributions to psychological knowledge; and, even if they were all retracted, this would have little impact on the main corpus of his work.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the prevalence, characteristics and reasons of Malaysian retracted papers. The Web of Science and Scopus databases were queried to identify Malaysian retracted publications. Available versions of original articles and publication notices were accessed from journal websites. The publications were assessed for various characteristics, including reason for retraction, based on the Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines, and the authority calling for the retractions. From 2009 to June 2017, 125 Malaysian publications comprising (33 journal articles and 92 conference papers) were retracted. There was a spike in the prevalence of retracted articles in 2010 and 2012 with 42 articles (33.6%) and 41 articles (32.8%) respectively from the 125 retracted articles. The mean time from electronic publication to retraction was 1\u00a0year. There is no significant relationship between a journal quartile and the mean number of months to retraction (P\u00a0=\u00a00.842). The reason for retraction for conference papers was specified as \u201cviolation of publication principle\u201d. Journal articles were retracted mainly for duplicate publication, plagiarism, compromised peer review process, and self-plagiarism. Most retracted articles do not contain flawed data; and only 2 retracted articles have been accused of scientific mistakes. The study concludes that retractions were mostly due to the authors misconduct. Despite the increases, the proportion of published scholarly literature affected by retraction remains very small, indicating that retraction represents an uncommon, yet potentially increasing and incipient, issue within Malaysian papers, which publishers as well as editors may have consistently and sufficiently addressed. \u00a9 2018, Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3, Budapest, Hungary.", "Comments": "Export Date: 19 July 2018 | Correspondence Address: Abrizah, A.; Department of Library and Information Science, Faculty of Computer & Information Technology, University of MalayaMalaysia; email: abrizah@um.edu.my | References: Abrizah, A., Badawi, F., Zoohorian-Fooladi, N., Nicholas, D., Jamali, H., Norliya, A.K., Trust and authority in the periphery of world scholarly communication: A Malaysian focus group study (2015) Malaysian Journal of Library & Information Science, 20 (2), pp. 67-83; Almeida, R.M.V.R., Catelani, F., Fontes-Pereira, A.J., Gave, N.S., Retractions in general and internal medicine in a high-profile scientific indexing database (2016) Sao Paola Medical Journal, 134 (1), pp. 74-78; Amos, K.A., The ethics of scholarly publishing: exploring differences in plagiarism and duplicate publication across nations (2014) Journal of Medical Library Association, 102 (2), pp. 87-91; Anderson, M.S., Ronning, E.A., De Vries, R., Martinson, B.C., The perverse effects of competition on scientists\u2019 work and relationships (2007) Science and Engineering Ethics, 13 (4), pp. 437-461; Bozzo, A., Bali, K., Evaniew, N., Ghert, M., Retractions in cancer research: A systematic survey (2017) Research Integrity and Peer Review; Budd, J.M., Sievert, M., Schultz, T.R., Scoville, C., Effects of article retraction on citation and practice in medicine (1998) Bulletin of the Medical Library Association, 87 (4), pp. 437-443; Cokol, M., Iossifov, I., Rodriguez-Esteban, R., Rzhesky, A., How many scientific papers should be retracted?

METHOD: The historical background of this issue was investigated through a literature search. The Instructions to Authors of 122 major biomedical journals were reviewed for evidence of a policy on the retraction of articles. Editors of those journals with no mention of retraction in their Instructions to Authors were contacted by email and/or postal mail. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of the journals investigated did not post or report having a policy on issuing retractions. Only twenty-one (18%) did. The remainder did not post any policy and did not respond to inquiries. DISCUSSION: Including policies in Instructions to Authors relating to the principled conduct of research and publication will improve the ethical environment in which the scientific community works.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "Keywords": "*Authorship\r\nBiomedical Research\r\nClinical Competence\r\nHumans\r\nJournalism, Medical/*standards\r\nPeriodicals as Topic/*standards\r\nProfessional Role\r\n*Retraction of Publication as Topic\r\nUnited States", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Atlas Michel C (2004) Retraction policies of high-impact biomedical journals.

Our objective was to examine the impact on clinically relevant research of a group of researchers' trial reports ('affected trial reports') affected by research misconduct, and whether identification of misconduct invoked a reappraisal. Design In 2016, we used five databases and search engines to identify 'citing publications', that is, guidelines, systematic and other reviews, and clinical trials citing any of 12 affected trial reports, published 1998-2011, eventually retracted for research misconduct. The affected trial reports were assessed more likely to have had impact because they had hip fracture outcomes and were in journals with impact factor >4. Two authors assessed whether findings of the citing publications would change if the affected trial reports were removed. In 2018, we searched for evidence that the citing publications had undertaken a reassessment as a result of the potential influence of the affected trial reports. Results By 2016 the affected trial reports were cited in 1158 publications, including 68 systematic reviews, meta-analyses, narrative reviews, guidelines and clinical trials. We judged that 13 guidelines, systematic or other reviews would likely change their findings if the affected trial reports were removed, and in another eight it was unclear if findings would change. By 2018, only one of the 68 citing publications, a systematic review, appeared to have undertaken a reassessment, which led to a correction. Conclusions We found evidence that this group of affected trial reports distorted the evidence base. Correction of these distortions is slow, uncoordinated and inconsistent. Unless there is a rapid, systematic, coordinated approach by bibliographic databases, authors, journals and publishers to mitigate the impact of known cases of research misconduct, patients, other researchers and their funders may continue to be adversely affected.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-031909", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Avenell Alison, Stewart Fiona, Grey Andrew, Gamble Greg D, and Bolland Mark J (2019) An investigation into the impact and implications of published papers from retracted research: systematic search of affected literature.

With bogus resumes filled with published journal articles, universities and other allied institutions are keen to recruit or sustain the appointment of such academics. This often places undue pressure on aspiring academics and on those already recruited to engage in research misconduct which often leads to research integrity. This structured review focuses on the ethics and integrity of management research through an analysis of retracted articles published from 2005 to 2016. The study employs a structured literature review methodology whereby retracted articles published between 2005 and 2016 in the field of management science were found using Crossref and Google Scholar. The searched articles were then streamlined by selecting articles based on their relevance and content in accordance with the inclusion criteria. Based on the analysed retracted articles, the study shows evidence of ethical misconduct among researchers of management science. Such misconduct includes data falsification, the duplication of submitted articles, plagiarism, data irregularity and incomplete citation practices. Interestingly, the analysed results indicate that the field of knowledge management includes the highest number of retracted articles, with plagiarism constituting the most significant ethical issue. Furthermore, the findings of this study show that ethical misconduct is not restricted to a particular geographic location; it occurs in numerous countries. In turn, avenues of further study on research misconduct in management research are proposed.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-017-9941-z ", "Keywords": "Ethics\r\nIntegrity\r\nManagement academic research\r\nMisconducts\r\nStructured review analysis", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Ayodele Freida Ozavize, Yao Liu, and Haron Hasnah (2019) Promoting ethics and integrity in management academic research: retraction initiative.

The objective of this research was, therefore, to report comprehensively on the nature and trend of retracted cardiovascular disease publications. Methods Medline (PubMed), Cochrane Library, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Retraction Watch databases were utilized to identify retracted publications on cardiovascular diseases from a database-specific inception date to June 10, 2019. Results A total of 568 publications met our eligibility criteria. With regard to the first author\u2019s continent of affiliation, the majority of retracted publications 251 (44.1%) originated from Asia. In 2000, the number of retracted publications began to trend up, and it peaked in 2015, with 76 (13.4%) publications being retracted that year. The mean number of times a publication was cited prior to retraction was 37 times, with a standard deviation of 76. Basic science publications and animal studies represented almost 43% of the total retracted publications relating to cardiovascular disease. Misconduct was the main reason for retractions in 249 (43.3%) publications, followed by scientific error by authors, 215 (37.8%). Almost 61% of the retracted studies were present in their intact form, with no watermark indicating retraction. Conclusions The trend of retracting publications within the field of cardiovascular diseases is increasing. Certain papers are still being cited even after retraction. Moreover, a significant number of retracted publications are still present with no watermark indicating retraction. The consequences of the continued usage of these retracted publications could be detrimental and harmful.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.21203/rs.2.22359/v1", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Badreldin Hisham, Ghawaa Yazeed, Alshehri Abdulmajeed, Alzaharani Mohammed, and Almubarak Abdulaziz (2020) Exploratory analysis of retracted cardiovascular diseases publications [preprint, Research Square]. : ,  DOI: 10.21203/rs.2.22359/v1", "type": "Publication", "Link": "http://doi.org/10.21203/rs.2.22359/v1", "label": "Exploratory analysis of retracted cardiovascular diseases publications [preprint, Research Square]", "author": ["Badreldin Hisham", "Ghawaa Yazeed", "Alshehri Abdulmajeed", "Alzaharani Mohammed", "Almubarak Abdulaziz"], "id": 58891701, "pub-type": "Report", "year": "2020", "Studies_related_to_discipline_or_geography": ["Field-specific study (including systematic reviews)", "Geography as a finding"], "Database_search_limitations": "Database source--field limitation", "Citation_of_retracted_papers": "Citation as focus--particular field of study", "Citation_context": "Citation--context not explored", "Other": "Retraction rates over time", "Processes_and_policies": ["Analysis of reasons for retraction", "Retracting authorities"], "Characteristics_of_retracted_papers": "Retracted papers--document/study characteristics", "Visibility_of_retraction_status": "Visibility/accessibility of retracted PAPERS", "Language": "English", "Perceptions_and_discussion_of_retracted_papers": "Altmetrics--social media shares according to publisher website"}, {"Codes": [{"AttributeId": 9095038, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095044, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9094969, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095055, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095065, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095068, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095066, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9564478, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}], "Outcomes": [], "ShortTitle": "Bakker (2018)", "DateCreated": "31/05/2021", "CreatedBy": "Katherine Howell", "DateEdited": "23/06/2021", "EditedBy": "Katherine Howell", "Month": "", "StandardNumber": "21623309", "City": "", "Country": "", "Publisher": "", "Institution": "", "Volume": "6", "Pages": "eP2199.", "Edition": "", "Issue": "(1),", "Availability": "", "URL": "http://jlsc-pub.org/articles/abstract/10.7710/2162-3309.2199/ files/167200/2162-3309.2199.html", "OldItemId": "", "Abstract": "INTRODUCTION Retractions are a mechanism by which science corrects itself, withdrawing statements or claims that have proven to be erroneous. However, this requires that such corrections be displayed clearly and consistently. This paper considers how retracted publications in the mental health literature are represented across different platforms. METHODS Using Retraction Watch, we identified 144 retracted articles in the mental health field. We looked across seven platforms to determine the consistency and clarity of the retracted status of these publications. RESULTS Of the 812 records for retracted publications, 40.0% (n=325) did not indicate that the paper had been retracted. Of available PDFs, 26.3% (53/201) did not indicate that the paper had been retracted. Of the 144 articles studied, only 10 were represented as being retracted across all resources through which they were available. DISCUSSION Retracted publications in this sample were inconsistently represented across library resources. While technical solutions, such as Crossmark by Crossref, may help mitigate these challenges, the inconsistent display of retractions has implications for education and outreach. CONCLUSION Our study found that the retractions in our sample were not clearly and consistently represented across sources. Libraries, which provide access to and training in these resources, have a responsibility to raise awareness of these inconsistencies and to advocate for more timely and accurate metadata.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.7710/2162-3309.2199", "Keywords": "visibility of retraction status", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Bakker Caitlin J, and Riegelman Amy (2018) Retracted publications in mental health literature: Discovery across bibliographic platforms.

Despite this, flawed research is still being incorporated into these publications. In this follow-up to our presentation of preliminary findings on the citation and use of retracted articles in higher levels of evidence in the field of pharmacy, we describe the characteristics of retracted publications cited in systematic and other evidence-based reviews and discuss the factors that may be associated with the likelihood of citation. Methods: Based on data provided by the Retraction Watch database, we identified retracted articles in pharmacy, toxicology, and drug design. We identified all articles citing these publications in Scopus and Web of Science before deduplicating these results and screening to identify systematic and other evidence-based reviews. We then identified whether the citation occurred prior to or following retraction of the original article, and analyzed which factors may be associated with the likelihood of a systematic review citing a retracted publication, both before and after its retraction. Results: Of 1,396 retracted publications, 283 were cited in 859 systematic reviews. Approximately 66% of the citations occurred before the retraction, and 34% after. Items were most frequently retracted due to data falsification or manipulation (38%), ethical misconduct including plagiarism (30%), or concerns about or errors in data or methods (28%). Compared to retracted articles not cited in systematic reviews, cited items were significantly more likely to be retracted due to data falsification and manipulation (p < .0001), to be published in high impact factor journals (p < .0001), and to have longer delays between publication and retraction (p <.0001). Conclusions: Retractions present challenges for researchers and librarians conducting and reading systematic reviews. Using retracted literature appropriately requires being able to identify and assess that literature. Librarians have a role in teaching critical thinking skills and can incorporate methodological assessment into instruction to provide students with the skills needed to assess systematic reviews. Additionally, librarians are in a unique position to contextualize problems associated with continued citation of retracted articles and advocate for transparency around the retraction process. This perspective can be used to build awareness of the challenges that retractions pose in systematic reviews among health sciences researchers, faculty, and students.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Bakker Caitlin J, Brown Sarah Jane, and Theis-Mahon Nicole R (2021) Are there retractions in your systematic review?

The papers belonging to the second category are most troublesome from the scientific point of view, as they are misleading and have serious negative implications not only on science but also on society. In this paper, we explore some temporal characteristics of retracted articles, including time of publication, years to retract, growth of post retraction citations over time and social media attention by the three major categories. The data set comprises 995 retracted articles retrieved in October 2014 from Elsevier\u2019s ScienceDirect. Citations and Mendeley reader counts were retrieved four times within 4 years, which allowed us to examine post-retraction longitudinal trends not only for citations, but also for Mendeley reader counts. The major findings are that both citation counts and Mendeley reader counts continue to grow after retraction. \u00a9 2018 Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3, Budapest, Hungary", "Comments": "Export Date: 19 July 2018 | Article in Press | Correspondence Address: Bar-Ilan, J.; Bar-Ilan UniversityIsrael; email: Judit.Bar-Ilan@biu.ac.il", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2802-y", "Keywords": "Altmetrics\nCitation analysis\nScientific fraud and dishonesty", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Bar-Ilan Judit, and Halevi Gali (2018) Temporal characteristics of retracted articles.

While it is possible that newspapers focus differential attention on publication of scientific articles and their subsequent retractions, this topic has received minimal attention from researchers. To learn more, we analyzed newspaper coverage of the high-profile 2002 article Severe dopaminergic neurotoxicity in primates after a common recreational dose regimen of MDMA (\u201cecstasy\u201d) and its retraction in a case study. We searched the 50 largest American newspapers with available online archives for stories about the article\u2019s publication and retraction. Of the 50 newspapers, 26 (52%) covered the article\u2019s publication and 20 (40%) its retraction. Six of the 50 newspapers (12%) published stories on the article\u2019s retraction without covering its initial publication. Of the 26 newspapers covering the article\u2019s publication, only 14 (54%) covered its retraction. Stories about the retraction were balanced, but shorter than those on the article\u2019s publication and often lacking in context and detail. While the decrease in coverage of the article\u2019s retraction was moderate among the entire sample, the much lower retraction coverage in newspapers that had already covered the article\u2019s publication is concerning and emphasizes the need for increased media coverage of retractions.", "Comments": "Export Date: 28 January 2021", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2020.1847365", "Keywords": "ecstasy\r\nMDMA\r\nmedia\r\nnewspaper\r\nretraction", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Barnett Brian S, and Doblin Richard (2021) Dissemination of erroneous research findings and subsequent retraction in high-circulation newspapers: a case study of alleged MDMA-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in primates.

Transparent and complete reporting of these studies could have provided peer reviewers and editors with sufficient information to question the methods used and the validity of results. Since these studies used routinely collected health data, the guidelines for the REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely collected health Data (RECORD) should have been applied to ensure complete reporting of the research. METHODS: We evaluated the two retracted articles for completeness of reporting using the RECORD for Pharmacoepidemiology (RECORD-PE) checklist, which includes the checklists for the STengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) and RECORD. We compared the proportion of STROBE, RECORD and RECORD-PE items adequately reported using Chi-squared statistics. RESULTS: In the article published by The Lancet, 29 of 34 STROBE items (85.3%) were adequately reported, compared with 3.5 of 13 RECORD items (26.9%) and 9.5 of 15 RECORD-PE items (63.3%)(\u03c7(2) = 14.839, P <0.001). Similarly, the article published in NEJM reported 24 of 34 STROBE items (70.6%), two of 13 RECORD items (15.4%), and 7.5 of 15 RECORD-PE items (50.0%) (\u03c7(2) = 11.668, P = 0.003). Important aspects of the methods unique to research using routinely collected health data were not reported, including variables used to identify exposure, outcome and confounders, validation of the coding or algorithms, a description of the underlying database population and the accuracy of data linkage methods. DISCUSSION: While STROBE items were generally adequately reported, RECORD and RECORD-PE items were not.

As the incidence of article retractions has increased over the last 2 decades, organizations have formed, including Retraction Watch, to improve the transparency of scientific publishing. At present, the incidence of article retraction in the obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine literature is unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the number of retracted articles within the obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine literature from the PubMed and Retraction Watch databases and examine reasons for retraction. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of the PubMed and Retraction Watch databases was performed to identify retracted articles in the obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine literature from indexation through December 31, 2019. The primary outcome was defined as the number of identified articles and reason for retraction. Within PubMed, articles were identified using a medical subheading search for articles categorized as withdrawn or retracted. In addition, the Retraction Watch database was queried and nonobstetrical articles were excluded. The reason for retraction was classified according to the categories listed in Retraction Watch. The subject matter was classified on the basis of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine criteria. Data were collected from retracted articles for author name, country, journal name and impact factor, year of publication and retraction, study type, and response of the publishing journal. Descriptive statistics were performed. RESULTS: Of the 519 obstetrics and gynecology articles in Retraction Watch, 122 (23.5%) were specific to the obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine specialties. In addition, 39 (32.0%) were identified from PubMed, all of which were included in Retraction Watch. There was a median time to retraction of 1 (range, 0-17) year, with a median of 3 citations per article (range, 0-145). In addition, the median journal impact factor was 2.2 (range, 0.1-27.6), with median first and senior author Hirsch index values of 6.0 and 13.5, respectively. Most articles were original research (n=80; 65.6%), specifically retrospective studies (n=11; 9.0%), case reports (n=19; 15.6%), prospective studies (n=18; 14.8%), randomized controlled trials (n=11; 9%), basic science (n=18; 14.8%), and systematic review or meta-analysis (n=3; 2.5%). Of eligible articles, 32 (26.2%) were published in journals with an impact factor \u22654, and 21 articles (17.2%) were published in the top 10 leading impact factor obstetrics and gynecology journals. Most retractions were for content-related issues (n=87; 71.3%), including 21.3% (n=26) for article duplication, 18.9% (n=23) for plagiarism, and 16.4% (n=20) for errors in results or methods. Additional reasons included author misconduct (n=12; 9.8%), nonreproducible results (n=11; 9.0%), and falsification (n=8; 6.6%). The most common journal response was an issued statement of retraction (n=82; 67.2%). Lack of retraction notice and limited to no information provided by the publishing journal occurred in 19 retracted articles (15.6%). CONCLUSION: In the obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine literature, retraction of scientific articles is increasing and is most often related to scientific misconduct, including article duplication and plagiarism. Improved prevention and detection are warranted by journals and healthcare institutions to ensure that invalid findings are not perpetuated in the medical literature, thereby avoiding adverse consequences for maternal and perinatal care.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100201 ", "Keywords": "article retraction\r\nduplication\r\nmaternal-fetal medicine\r\nobstetrics\r\nplagiarism\r\nscientific misconduct", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Bennett Carrie, Chambers Laura M, Al-Hafez Leen, Michener Chad M, Falcone Tommaso, Yao Meng, and Berghella Vincenzo (2020) Retracted articles in the obstetrics literature: lessons from the past to change the future.

This paper builds on the concepts of competing logics and institutional fields to analyze a serious case of medical and scientific misconduct at a leading research institute, Karolinska in Sweden, home to the Nobel Prize in Medicine. By distinguishing between a market-oriented, a medical and an academic logic, the study analyzes how various actors - executives, research leaders, co-authors, journal editors, medical doctors, science bloggers, investigative journalists and documentary filmmakers - sustained or tried to expose the misconduct. Despite repeated warnings from patient-responsible doctors and external academic reviewers, Karolinska protected the surgeon, Paolo Macchiarini, until a documentary film at the Swedish national public TV exposed the fraud which led to public inquiries and proposals for a new national ethics legislation. The analysis illustrates the power of a market-oriented logic focused on brand and image at the research institute and at a leading journal, but also the perseverance of the logics of scientific scrutiny and medical care among practicing doctors and independent academics although the carriers of these logics were less well organized than the carriers of the market-oriented logic. Furthermore, the analysis shows the problem of fragmented control in the academic institutional field. The discussion of remedies compares the Karolinska case, where media actors were instrumental in sanctioning the perpetrators, with a similar instance of medical misconduct at Duke in the US where the government agency (ORI) intervened and shows the limitations of both types of actors. The conclusion highlights the importance of studying misconduct management and institution-building in different fields to develop effective remedies", "Comments": "See \"5.2.

The present study did an objective assessment of instructions to authors on the websites of Indian biomedical journals in PubMed and IndMED and retractions in these journals from January 2012 to October 2017. METHODS: A 14-point checklist based on previous studies and review of literature was used. A total of 110 journals were included in the study and their websites assessed. RESULTS: A dedicated section on ethics was found in 56 (50.9%) journal websites, 42 (38.2%) did not mention any specific bioethics guidelines, animal ethics was mentioned in 65 (59%) of the journals, and an ethics committee approval was required by 65 (59%) of the journals. Sixty-four (58.2%) journals mentioned mandatory informed consent and 19 (17.3%) required assent. There were 22 (20%) journals that required neither Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) registration nor Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for reporting of clinical trials. There were 38 (34.5%) journals that actively looked for plagiarism. Most common reason for retraction was duplicate publication (23, 38.4%) followed by plagiarism (17,28.3%).

The 59 instances of inappropriate image duplication led to 41 corrections, 5 retractions, and 13 instances in which no action was taken. Our experience suggests that the majority of inappropriate image duplications result from errors during figure preparation that can be remedied by correction. Nevertheless, approximately 10% of papers with inappropriate image duplications in MCB were retracted ( approximately 0.5% of total). If this proportion is representative, then as many as 35,000 papers in the literature are candidates for retraction due to inappropriate image duplication. The resolution of inappropriate image duplication concerns after publication required an average of 6 h of journal staff time per published paper. MCB instituted a pilot program to screen images of accepted papers prior to publication that identified 12 manuscripts (14.5% out of 83) with image concerns in 2 months. The screening and correction of papers before publication required an average of 30 min of staff time per problematic paper. Image screening can identify papers with problematic images prior to publication, reduces postpublication problems, and requires less staff time than the correction of problems after publication.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1128/MCB.00309-18 ", "Keywords": "*Cell Biology\r\nEditorial Policies\r\n*Molecular Biology\r\nPilot Projects\r\n*Publishing\r\nRetraction of Publication as Topic\r\nScientific Experimental Error/statistics & numerical data\r\nScientific Misconduct/statistics & numerical data\r\n*duplications\r\n*image\r\n*publication", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Bik Elisabeth M, Fang Ferric C, Kullas Amy L, Davis Roger J, and Casadevall Arturo (2018) Analysis and correction of inappropriate image duplication: the Molecular and Cellular Biology experience.

The PubMed database was searched on June 2017 to retrieve the retracted articles, and the Scopus database was screened to identify the post-retraction citations. The full text was screened to see the type of post-retraction citation (positive/negative) and whether the cited article appears or not as retracted. One hundred and two retractions were identified, representing 3.5% of the retracted articles indexed by PubMed, out of which 54 were included in the analysis. Half of the articles were retracted in the first 24 months after publication, and the number of post retraction citations was higher than the number of citations before retraction in 30 out of 54 cases (US methods: 9/20, other diagnostic methods 21/34, P-value = 0.2312). The plagiarism was the most common reason for retraction (31%), followed by repetitive publication (26%), and errors in data/manuscript (24%). In less than 2% of cases, the retracted articles appear as retracted in the text or reference list, while the negative citation is observed in 4.84% among manuscripts reporting an US diagnostic method and 0.32% among manuscripts reporting a diagnostic method other than US (P-value = 0.0004). No significant differences were observed when post retraction weighted citation index (WCI, no. of citations weighted by citation window) was compared to WCI prior retraction (P-value = 0.5972).

Results: 10/12 journals responded: 3 after one email, 5 after two emails, and 2 after three emails (median time from first email to response: 21 days; no difference in response times to journalist or academics, P = 0.25). Of the 10 responses, 8 indicated the journal was investigating, 5 had a positive tone, 4 a neutral tone, and 1 a negative tone. Five of the enquiries by the academics produced information of limited use and 1 no useful information, whereas none of the 6 journalist enquiries produced useful information (P = 0.015). None of the 10 responses was considered very useful.

These 2 types of written evidence of disputes are compared by analyzing their occurrence in relation to articles that have already been retracted or corrected. We identified retracted or corrected articles in a corpus of 72,069 articles coming from the Engineering field, from 3 journals (Science, Tumor Biology, Cancer Research) and from 3 authors with many retractions to their credit (Sarkar, Sch\u00f6n, Voinnet). We used Scite to retrieve contradicting citations and PubPeer to retrieve the number of comments for each article, and then we considered them as traces left by scientists to contest published results. Our study shows that contradicting citations are very uncommon and that retracted or corrected articles are not more contradicted in scholarly articles than those that are neither retracted nor corrected but they do generate more comments on Pubpeer, presumably because of the possibility for contributors to remain anonymous. Moreover, post-publication peer review platforms, although external to the scientific publication process contribute more to the correction of science than negative citations. Consequently, post-publication peer review venues, and more specifically the comments found on it, although not contributing to the scientific literature, are a mechanism for correcting science. Lastly, we introduced the idea of strengthening the role of contradicting citations to rehabilitate the clear expression of judgment in scientific papers.", "Comments": "Export Date: 28 January 2021", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-020-03536-z", "Keywords": "Corrected articles\r\nIn-text citations\r\nNegative citations\r\nPost-publication peer review\r\nRetracted articles\r\nSelf-correction of science", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Bordignon Frederique (2020) Self-correction of science: A comparative study of negative citations and post-publication peer review.

The aim of this study was to analyze the extent of retracted articles pertaining to rehabilitation. METHODS: Retracted articles were searched in 4 different bibliographic databases from their inception to April 2020: PubMed, Web of Science, WikiLetters and Retraction Watch. Three independent reviewers assessed the relevance of the retrieved articles to the rehabilitation area. RESULTS: Of 280 rehabilitation-related publications retracted between 1984 and 2020, 83 (29.6%) were published in 55 full open access journals and 197 (70.4%) were published in 147 traditional, non-open access or hybrid journals. In the last 10 years (2009-2018) there was a significant steady increase in both the total number of retractions (p\u2009<\u20090.005; r\u2009=\u20090.856; R(2)\u00a0=\u20090.733) and retraction rate per year (p\u00a0<\u20090.05; r\u2009=\u20090.751; R(2)\u00a0=\u20090.564). However, the number of retractions represents a very small percentage (~\u20090.1%) of the overall volume of publications in rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the number of retracted articles in rehabilitation is increasing, although the phenomenon is still limited. However, the true prevalence of misconduct may go unnoticed due to the large number of low-quality journals not indexed in the searched databases.

In this study, to better understand the perpetuation of discredited research, we examine the number of citations of Reuben's articles within 5 years of their retraction. Citations of Reuben's retracted articles were assessed using the Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters, NY). All citing articles were screened to discriminate between articles in which Reuben's work was quoted as retracted, and articles in which his data was wrongly cited without any note of the retraction status. Twenty of Reuben's publications had been cited 274 times between 2009 and 1024. In 2014, 45 % of the retracted articles had been cited at least once. In only 25.8 % of citing articles was it clearly stated that Reuben's work had been retracted. Annual citations decreased from 108 in 2009 to 18 in 2014; however, the percentage of publications correctly indicating the retraction status also declined. The percentage of citations in top-25 %-journals, as well as the percentage of citations in journals from Reuben's research area, declined sharply after 2009.

The objective of this study was to determine the frequency and reason for retraction of cancer publications and to determine how journals in the cancer field handle retracted articles. Methods: We searched three online databases (MEDLINE, Embase, The Cochrane Library) from database inception until 2015 for retracted journal publications related to cancer research. For each article, the reason for retraction was categorized as plagiarism, duplicate publication, fraud, error, authorship issues, or ethical issues. Accessibility of the retracted article was defined as intact, removed, or available but with a watermark over each page. Descriptive data was collected on each retracted article including number of citations, journal name and impact factor, study design, and time between publication and retraction. The publications were screened in duplicated and two reviewers extracted and categorized data. Results: Following database search and article screening, we identified 571 retracted cancer publications. The majority (76.4%) of cancer retractions were issued in the most recent decade, with 16.6 and 6.7% of the retractions in the prior two decades respectively. Retractions were issued by journals with impact factors ranging from 0 (discontinued) to 55.8. The average impact factor was 5.4 (median 3.54, IQR 1.8-5.5). On average, a retracted article was cited 45 times (median 18, IQR 6-51), with a range of 0-742. Reasons for retraction include plagiarism (14.4%), fraud (28.4%), duplicate publication (18.2%), error (24.2%), authorship issues (3.9%), and ethical issues (2.1%). The reason for retraction was not stated in 9.8% of cases. Twenty-nine percent of retracted articles remain available online in their original form. Conclusions: Retractions in cancer research are increasing in frequency at a similar rate to all biomedical research retractions. Cancer retractions are largely due to academic misconduct. Consequences to cancer patients, the public at large, and the research community can be substantial and should be addressed with future research. Despite the implications of this important issue, some cancer journals currently fall short of the current guidelines for clearly stating the reason for retraction and identifying the publication as retracted.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-017-0031-1 ", "Keywords": "Cancer\r\nCancer research\r\nOncology\r\nOncology research\r\nResearch ethics\r\nRetraction\r\nRetractions", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Bozzo Anthony, Bali Kamal, Evaniew Nathan, and Ghert Michelle (2017) Retractions in cancer research: a systematic survey.

Data integrity is a common discussion topic, and it is widely assumed that publicity surrounding such matters will accelerate correction of the scientific record. This study aimed to test this assumption by examining a collection of 497 papers for which data integrity had been questioned either in public or in private. As such, the papers were divided into two sub-sets: a public set of 274 papers discussed online, and the remainder a private set of 223 papers not publicized. The sources of alleged data problems, as well as criteria for defining problem data, and communication of problems to journals and appropriate institutions, were similar between the sets. The number of laboratory groups represented in each set was also similar (75 in public, 62 in private), as was the number of problem papers per laboratory group (3.65 in public, 3.54 in private). Over a study period of 18 months, public papers were retracted 6.5-fold more, and corrected 7.7-fold more, than those in the private set. Parsing the results by laboratory group, 28 laboratory groups in the public set had papers which received corrective action, versus 6 laboratory groups in the private set. For those laboratory groups in the public set with corrected/retracted papers, the fraction of their papers acted on was 62% of those initially flagged, whereas in the private set this fraction was 27%. Such clustering of actions suggests a pattern in which correction/retraction of one paper from a group correlates with more corrections/retractions from the same group, with this pattern being stronger in the public set. It is therefore concluded that online discussion enhances levels of corrective action in the scientific literature. Nevertheless, anecdotal discussion reveals substantial room for improvement in handling of such matters.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.313", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Brookes Paul S (2014) Internet publicity of data problems in the bioscience literature correlates with enhanced corrective action.

In the field of biomedical sciences, in particular, the use of images to depict laboratory results is widely diffused, at such a level that one would not err in saying that there is barely any experimental paper devoid of images to document the attained results. With the advent of software for digital image manipulation, however, even photographic reproductions of experimental results may be easily altered by researchers, leading to an increasingly high rate of scientific papers containing unreliable images. In this paper I introduce a software pipeline to detect some of the most diffuse misbehaviours, running two independent tests on a random set of papers and on the full publishing record of a single journal.

Citations to retracted articles should, theoretically, be minimal. Despite these notifications of retraction in PubMed and elsewhere, the articles continue to receive citations. The 1999 study found that the retracted articles received more than 2,000 post-retraction citations, with less than 8% of the citations acknowledging the retraction in any way. Preliminary examination of the present data set illustrates that continued citation remains a problem. Of 391 citations analyzed, only 6% acknowledge the retraction.

Recent work in research ethics has devoted important attention to how to improve the system of paper retraction. In this context, the focus has primarily been on how to handle fraudulent or flawed research papers and how to encourage the retraction of papers based on honest mistakes. Less attention has been paid to whether papers that report unethical research-for example, research performed without appropriate concern for the moral rights and interests of the research participants-should be retracted. The aim of this paper is to examine to what extent retraction policies of academic journals and publishers address retractions of unethical research and to discuss critically various policy options and the reasons for accepting them. The paper starts by reviewing retraction policies of academic publishers. The results show that many journals do not have explicit policies for how to handle unethical research. Against this background, we then discuss four normative arguments for why unethical research should be retracted. In conclusion, we suggest a retraction policy in light of our empirical and normative investigations.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106140 ", "Keywords": "applied and professional ethics\r\npublication ethics\r\nresearch ethics", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "B\u00fclow William, Godskesen Tove E, Helgesson Gert, and Eriksson Stefan (2020) Why unethical papers should be retracted [Online First].

We have compared journal responses to a specific reagent error in 31 human gene knockdown publications, namely a non-targeting or negative control nucleotide sequence that is instead predicted to target a human gene. The 31 papers published by 13 biomedical journals generated 26 published responses (14 retractions, 5 expressions of concern, 7 author corrections which included one resolved expression of concern) as well as 6 stated decisions to take no action. Variations in published responses were noted both between journals and by 4 journals that published different responses to at least 2 papers. A subset of published responses revealed conflicting explanations for the wrongly identified control reagent, despite 30/31 papers obtaining their gene knockdown reagents from the same external supplier. Viewed collectively, different journal responses to human gene knockdown publications with a common reagent error type suggest that editorial staff require more support to interpret post-publication notifications of incorrect nucleotide sequence reagents. We propose a draft template to facilitate the communication, interpretation and investigation of published errors, including errors affecting research reagents.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-021-03871-9", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Byrne Jennifer A, Park Yasunori, West Rachael A, Capes-Davis Amanda, Favier Bertrand, Cabanac Guillaume, and Labb\u00e9 Cyril (2021) The thin ret(raction) line: biomedical journal responses to incorrect non-targeting nucleotide sequence reagents in human gene knockdown publications.

METHOD: A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed including all retracted publications from January 1st, 2013-December 31st, 2016 indexed in PubMed. The causes of retraction were classified as: data management, authorship issues, plagiarism, unethical research, journal issues, review process, conflict of interest, other causes, and unknown reasons. Then, misbehaviour was classified as misconduct, suspicion of misconduct or no misconduct suspicion. RESULTS: 1,082 retracted publications were identified. The retraction rate for the period was 2.5 per 10,000 publications. The main cause of retraction was misconduct (65.3%), and the leading reasons were plagiarism, data management and compromise of the review process. The highest proportion of retracted publications corresponded to Iran (15.52 per 10,000), followed by Egypt and China (11.75 and 8.26 per 10,000).

Method: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted. All papers retracted and indexed in PubMed from January 1st 2013 to December 31st, 2016 were included. We used nine main categories to classify retractions: aspects related with data, authors issues, plagiarism, unethical research, journal issues, review process, conflict of interest, other, and unknown. These categories were further classified as: misconduct, suspicion of misconduct, or no misconduct. Results: The proportion of retraction was 2.5 per 10,000 publications. Retractions appeared in 611 journals. During the study period, retraction due to misconduct was more frequent among journals with low-impact factor. Within these retracted publications, among low-impact journals the presence of misconduct was higher with a 73% compared to 61% for the high-impact journals (p = 0.001). There were differences in the percentage of retractions due to misconduct regarding the journal classification category (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Retraction of publications is present in both high- and low-impact factor biomedical journals, but misconduct is more frequent among the papers retracted from lower impact journals.

This study was conducted to analyse the association of retraction on citations received by retracted papers due to misconduct using two-time frames: during a postretraction period equivalent to the time the article had been in print before retraction; and during the total postretraction period. Methods Quasiexperimental, pre-post evaluation study. A total of 304 retracted original articles and literature reviews indexed in MEDLINE fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Articles were required to have been published in a journal indexed in MEDLINE from January 2013 through December 2015 and been retracted between January 2014 and December 2016. The main outcome was the number of citations received before and after retraction. Results were broken down by journal quartile according to impact factor and the most cited papers during the preretraction period were specifically analysed. Results There was an increase in postretraction citations when compared with citations received preretraction. There were some exceptions however: first, citations received by articles published in first-quartile journals decreased immediately after retraction (p<0.05), only to increase again after some time had elapsed; and second, postretraction citations decreased significantly in the case of articles that had received many citations before their retraction (p<0.05).

Authors with misconduct retractions can be serial offenders (high-risk authors). We investigated 1) the feasibility of cross-matching debarment and retracted publications lists, and 2) how well debarment searching could detect retracted authors.\r\rResearch design and methods: For this quantitative and qualitative assessment, we exported (11/08/2015) data from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Debarment List and the MEDLINE Retracted Publications database (both freely accessible). Every debarred individual was checked against all authors of all retracted publications. Potential matches were further investigated to ensure cross-match validity. Searching time was recorded. A case study was conducted on the cross-matched author with the highest retraction record.\r\rResults: Cross-matching was feasible; each debarred author could be checked within 5 minutes. The FDA Debarment List (n = 139 entries; US focus) was less comprehensive than the Retracted Publications database (n = 4013 entries; global focus). There were only 2 (1.5%) matches between debarred individuals and retracted authors; both retracted authors were serial offenders for publication misconduct. The case study showed debarment didn\u2019t occur until 2 years after 18 publications had already been retracted.\r\rConclusions: The Retracted Publications database, more global and  30-fold larger than the FDA Debarment List, could provide sponsors and agencies with a free, practical, timely, relevant, and comprehensive way to help avoid high-risk authors. Future CIAs, as well as Good Publication Practice guidelines and company policies, could consider recommending a Retracted Publications search before author engagement.\r\rAcknowledgments: The authors acknowledge project management support from Dr Thao Le (Envision Pharma Group).", "Comments": "supplement of Current Medical Research and Opinion\n\n[abstract is full-text] Part of Abstracts from the 12th Annual Meeting of ISMPP.

We recently reported that the majority of retractions are associated with scientific misconduct. In the current study, we focused on the subset of retractions for which no misconduct was identified, in order to identify the major causes of error. Analysis of the retraction notices for 423 articles indexed in PubMed revealed that the most common causes of error-related retraction are laboratory errors, analytical errors, and irreproducible results. The most common laboratory errors are contamination and problems relating to molecular biology procedures (e.g., sequencing, cloning). Retractions due to contamination were more common in the past, whereas analytical errors are now increasing in frequency. A number of publications that have not been retracted despite being shown to contain significant errors suggest that barriers to retraction may impede correction of the literature. In particular, few cases of retraction due to cell line contamination were found despite recognition that this problem has affected numerous publications. An understanding of the errors leading to retraction can guide practices to improve laboratory research and the integrity of the scientific literature. Perhaps most important, our analysis has identified major problems in the mechanisms used to rectify the scientific literature and suggests a need for action by the scientific community to adopt protocols that ensure the integrity of the publication process.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1096/fj.14-256735", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Casadevall Arturo, Steen R Grant, and Fang Ferric C (2014) Sources of error in the retracted scientific literature.

RESULTS: We found 130 retracted articles in 49 journals (49%). Five or more retracted articles were published in 8 journals (8%). The mean time between publication and retraction was 26 months (range 1 to 158 months). The United States, China, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom accounted for more than 3 out of 4 of the retracted articles. The greatest number of retractions came from manuscripts about orthopedics and traumatology, general surgery, anesthesiology, cardiothoracic surgery, and plastic surgery. Nonsurgeons were responsible for 16% of retractions in these surgery journals. The main reasons for retraction were duplicate publication (42%), plagiarism (16%), absence of proven integrity of the study (14%), incorrect data (13%), data published without authorization (12%), violation of research ethics (11%), documented fraud (11%), request of an author(s) (5%), and unknown (3%). In 25% of the retracted articles, other publications by the same authors also had been retracted. CONCLUSION: Retraction of published articles does not occur frequently in surgery journals. Some form of scientific misconduct was present in the majority of retractions, especially duplication of publication and plagiarism. Retractions of previously published articles were most frequent from countries with the greatest number of publications; some authors showed recidivism.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2018.01.015 ", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Cass\u00e3o Bruna Dell'Acqua, Herbella Fernando AM, Schlottmann Francisco, and Patti Marco G (2018) Retracted articles in surgery journals.

DESIGN: Retrospective review of the PubMed database. SETTING: N/A. POPULATION: Obstetrics and gynaecology articles published from indexation until June 2018. METHODS: Articles were identified using keywords for retracted articles in obstetrics and gynaecology. Descriptive statistics were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of article retraction, the reasons given for retraction, and article demographics. RESULTS: A total of 176 articles were identified with a median time to retraction of 2 years; over three-quarters were retracted within the last decade (n = 136; 77.3%). The median journal impact factor was 2.5 (range of 0.26-52.67). Subspecialties with the highest number of retractions were gynaecological oncology (n = 76; 43.2%), gynaecology (n = 36; 20.5%), and obstetrics (n = 31; 17.6%). Among 176 first authors, 18 authors (10.2%) had two or more retracted articles. Clinical research articles accounted for approximately one-half of the retracted articles (n = 87; 49.4%). Among the clinical studies, 10.2% (n = 18) were randomised control trials, 16.5% (n = 29) were prospective trials and 13.1% (n = 23) were retrospective studies. Plagiarism (n = 40; 22.7%) and data falsification (n = 37; 21.0%) were the most common reasons given for retraction. CONCLUSION: Article retraction within the obstetrics and gynaecology literature is increasing. The most frequently cited reasons for article retractions were plagiarism, errors in data, fabricated results, article duplication, and compromised peer review. Consequences of article retractions to patient care and the scientific community can be significant. The thorough screening of manuscripts prior to publication should be prioritised.

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify all retracted publications in the field of emergency medicine. We also searched an independent website that reports and archives retracted scientific publications. Two researchers independently screened titles, abstracts and full text of search results. Data from all included studies were then independently extracted. RESULTS: We identified 28 retraction notes. Eleven (39%) articles were published by authors from Europe. The oldest retracted article was published in 2001. The 28 retracted papers were published by 22 different journals. Two authors were named on multiples retractions. The median impact factor of journals was 1.03 (0.6-1.9). Almost all studies were available online [26/28 (93%)], but only 40% had watermarking on the article. The retraction notification was available for all articles. Three (11%) retraction notices did not clearly report the retraction reasons, and most retraction notices were issued by the editors [14 (56%)]. The most frequent retraction reasons were plagiarism [eight (29%)], duplicate publication [three (11%)] and overlap [two (2%)]. Retracted articles were cited on average 14 times. In most cases, the retraction cause did not invalidate the study's results [17 (60%)]. CONCLUSION: The most common reason for retraction was related to a misconduct by the authors.

Retraction is a self-correction mechanism of the scientific community to maintain and safeguard the integrity of scientific literature. However, a retracted article may pose a profound and long-lasting threat to the credibility of the literature. New articles may unknowingly build their work on false claims made in retracted articles. Such dependencies on retracted articles may become implicit and indirect. Consequently, it becomes increasingly important to detect implicit and indirect threats. In this article, our aim is to raise the awareness of the potential threats of retracted articles even after their retraction and demonstrate a visual analytic study of retracted articles with reference to the rest of the literature and how their citations are influenced by their retraction. The context of highly cited retracted articles is visualized in terms of a co-citation network as well as the distribution of articles that have high-order citation dependencies on retracted articles. Survival analyses of time to retraction and postretraction citation are included. Sentences that explicitly cite retracted articles are extracted from full-text articles. Transitions of topics over time are depicted in topic-flow visualizations.

This review shows that most documented cases of scientific fraud involve falsification (altering truthful information) and fabrication (inventing information where none previously existed). Plagiarism is much less frequent. The review of published accounts also shows that the publication of scientific papers containing recognizable fraudulent material is very low, probably less than 0.02% and extremely difficult to detect. Because most reported cases of fraud have involved research done at prestigious organizations with distinguished co-authors, and that is published in journals with exacting review processes, it becomes evident that some unscrupulous scientists are adept at fabricating and falsifying data. However, \"significant\" scientific fraud is detected when scientists repeatedly report results that cannot be independently verified, when colleagues report suspicious behavior, or scientific audits are performed. This review documents and compares many of the better-known cases of scientific fraud.

DESIGN: Blinded case-control study. SETTING: Journals in PubMed. POPULATION: 50 manuscripts, classified on PubMed as retracted clinical trials, paired with 50 adjacent unretracted manuscripts from the same journals. Reports were randomly selected from PubMed in December 2012, with no restriction on publication date. Controls were the preceding unretracted clinical trial published in the same journal. All traces of retraction were removed. Three scientists, blinded to the retraction status of individual reports, reviewed all 100 trial reports for discrepancies. Discrepancies were pooled and cross checked before being counted into prespecified categories. Only then was the retraction status unblinded for analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Total number of discrepancies (defined as mathematically or logically contradictory statements) in each clinical trial report. RESULTS: Of 479 discrepancies found in the 100 trial reports, 348 were in the 50 retracted reports and 131 in the 50 unretracted reports. On average, individual retracted reports had a greater number of discrepancies than unretracted reports (median 4 (interquartile range 2-8.75) v 0 (0-5); P<0.001). Papers with a discrepancy were significantly more likely to be retracted than those without a discrepancy (odds ratio 5.7 (95% confidence interval 2.2 to 14.5); P<0.001). In particular, three types of discrepancy arose significantly more frequently in retracted than unretracted reports: factual discrepancies (P=0.002), arithmetical errors (P=0.01), and missed P values (P=0.02). Results from a retrospective analysis indicated that citations and journal impact factor were unlikely to affect the result. CONCLUSIONS: Discrepancies in published trial reports should no longer be assumed to be unimportant. Scientists, blinded to retraction status and with no specialist skill in the field, identify significantly more discrepancies in retracted than unretracted reports of clinical trials. Discrepancies could be an early and accessible signal of unreliability in clinical trial reports. \u00a9 Cole et al 2015.", "Comments": "Cited By :5 | Export Date: 21 April 2020", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.h4708", "Keywords": "case control study\r\nethics\r\nhuman\r\njournal impact factor\r\nMedline\r\nodds ratio\r\npublishing\r\nretrospective study\r\nscientific misconduct\r\nCase-Control Studies\r\nHumans\r\nJournal Impact Factor\r\nOdds Ratio\r\nPublication Bias\r\nPubMed\r\nRetrospective Studies\r\nScientific Misconduct", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Cole Graham D, Nowbar Alexandra N, Mielewczik Michael, Shun-Shin Matthew J, and Francis Darrel P (2015) Frequency of discrepancies in retracted clinical trial reports versus unretracted reports: blinded case-control study.

I analysed articles published by Sustainability in 2015 and found that self-citations are higher than expected under a uniform probability distribution. Self-citations in this journal make a 36% difference to the journal's impact factor. This research raises the question of what citation patterns can be expected as normal, and where the boundary between normal and anomaly lies.

But what do they point to? A hypothesis has found its way into the recent literature: they could be an early sign of impact, conveying in advance the information carried later by citations. Here the focus is on another possible relationship, namely, the one that may exist between alternative metrics and retractions. The research question is as follows: in comparison to non-retracted, contemporary publications, are the retracted articles likely to be more (or less) viewed and commented (but also \u00abtweeted\u00bb and \u00abblogged\u00bb) before the retraction takes place? The above relationship is tested on a set of n = 209 papers retracted by PLoS ONE and a control group including 2n = 418 contemporary, non-retracted articles featured in the same journal. Significant and positive differences in means are found concerning the mentions in peer review sites and the number of views and downloads.

We compare findings with recent studies of retracted papers in economics, and business and management, to profile practices that are likely to be problematic in cognate social science disciplines. In psychology, the principal reason for retraction was data fabrication. Retractions took longer to make, and generally were from higher ranked and more prestigious journals, than in the two cognate disciplines. We recommend that journal editors should be more forthcoming in the reasons they provide for article retractions. We also recommend that the discipline of psychology gives a greater priority to the publication of replication studies; initiates a debate about how to respond to failed replications; adopts a more critical attitude to the importance of attaining statistical significance; discourages p-hacking and Hypothesizing After Results are Known (HARKing); assesses the long-term effects of pre-registering research; and supports stronger procedures to attest to the authenticity of data in research papers. Our contribution locates these issues in the context of a growing crisis of confidence in the value of social science research. We also challenge individual researchers to reassert the primacy of disinterested academic inquiry above pressures that can lead to an erosion of scholarly integrity. \u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.", "Comments": "Export Date: 21 April 2020\rSystematic review", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2020.103930", "Keywords": "Misconduct\r\nPsychology\r\nReplication\r\nResearch\r\nRetractions\r\nBehavioral research\r\nPersonal computing\r\nResearch\r\nBusiness and management\r\nMisconduct\r\nPsychology\r\nReplication\r\nRetractions\r\nScience disciplines\r\nSocial science research\r\nStatistical significance\r\nEconomics", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Craig Russell, Cox Adam, Tourish Dennis, and Thorpe Alistair (2020) Using retracted journal articles in psychology to understand research misconduct in the social sciences: What is to be done?.

We aim to: (a) describe the reasons for retraction of genetics articles and the time elapsed between the publication of an article and that of the retraction notice because of research misconduct (ie, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism); and (b) compare all these variables between retracted medical genetics (MG) and non-medical genetics (NMG) articles. Methods: All retracted genetics articles published between 1970 and 2018 were retrieved from the Retraction Watch database. The reasons for retraction were fabrication/falsification, plagiarism, duplication, unreliability, and authorship issues. Articles subject to investigation by company/institution, journal, US Office for Research Integrity or third party were also retrieved. Results: 1582 retracted genetics articles (MG, n=690; NMG, n=892) were identified. Research misconduct and duplication were involved in 33% and 24% of retracted papers, respectively; 37% were subject to investigation. Only 0.8% of articles involved both fabrication/falsification and plagiarism. In this century the incidence of both plagiarism and duplication increased statistically significantly in genetics retracted articles; conversely, fabrication/falsification was significantly reduced. Time to retraction due to scientific misconduct was statistically significantly shorter in the period 2006-2018 compared with 1970-2000. Fabrication/falsification was statistically significantly more common in NMG (28%) than in MG (19%) articles. MG articles were significantly more frequently investigated (45%) than NMG articles (31%). Time to retraction of articles due to fabrication/falsification was significantly shorter for MG (mean 4.7 years) than for NMG (mean 6.4 years) articles; no differences for plagiarism (mean 2.3 years) were found. The USA (mainly NMG articles) and China (mainly MG articles) accounted for the largest number of retracted articles. Conclusion: Genetics is a discipline with a high article retraction rate (estimated retraction rate 0.15%). Fabrication/falsification and plagiarism were almost mutually exclusive reasons for article retraction. Retracted MG articles were more frequently subject to investigation than NMG articles. Retracted articles due to fabrication/falsification required 2.0-2.8 times longer to retract than when plagiarism was involved. \u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The Retraction Watch (RW) database is the largest worldwide database on retracted articles. The objective was to determine the reasons for and features of retracted biomedical articles by Spanish authors. Material and methods: A search was conducted in the RW database of 7 types of scientific articles from 9 biomedicine disciplines \u2212biology, genetics, medicine, microbiology, neurosciences, nutrition, dentistry, public health and toxicology\u2212, with at least one author working in a Spanish centre, and published between 1970 and 2018. The features of the articles and the reasons for their retraction were recorded. Results: Of the 18,621 retracted articles, 217 (1%) were by Spanish authors; 155 (74%) were on biomedicine and the types of articles of interest. In most cases, there were several reasons for retracting an article. Research misconduct (fabrication, falsification, plagiarism) and duplication were involved in 25% and 35% of the cases, respectively. Twenty-two percent of the articles were retracted due to errors by the authors or the journals. A dentist retracted 18 articles \u2212all from the same journal and in the same year, 2018\u2212, which accounts for 12% of all retracted biomedicine articles. Conclusion: The number of retracted biomedicine articles by Spanish authors is low.

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.We aimed to quantify the number of pre- and post-retraction citations obtained by genetics articles retracted due to research misconduct. All retraction notices available in the Retraction Watch database for genetics articles published in 1970\u20132016 were assessed. The reasons for retraction were fabrication/falsification and plagiarism. The endpoints were the number of citations of retracted articles and when and how journals reported on retractions and whether this was published on PubMed. Four hundred and sixty retracted genetics articles were cited 34,487 times; 7,945 (23%) were post-retraction citations. Median time to retraction and time to last citation were 3.2 and 3 years, respectively. Most (96%) had a PubMed retraction notice, One percent of these were totally removed from journal websites altogether, and 4% had no information available on either the online or PDF versions. Ninety percent of citations were from articles retracted due to falsification/fabrication. The percentage of post-retraction citations was significantly higher in the case of plagiarism (42%) than in the case of fabrication/falsification (21.5%) (p<0.001). Median time to retraction was shorter (1.3 years) in the case of plagiarism than for fabrication/falsification (4.8 years, p<0.001). The retraction was more frequently reported in the PDFs (70%) for the fabrication/falsification cases than for the plagiarism cases (43%, p<0.001). The highest rate of retracted papers due to falsification/fabrication was among authors in the USA, and the highest rate for plagiarism was in China. Although most retractions were appropriately handled by journals, the gravest issue was that median time to retraction for articles retracted for falsification/fabrication was nearly 5 years, earning close to 6800 post-retraction citations.

One of the major mechanisms of self-correction is retraction of flawed work. Aim: To study the various parameters associated with retraction of scientific articles in 2012 and 2013 and discuss the current trends in article retraction over the period of 2 years. Materials and Methods: Data were retrieved from MEDLINE (via PubMed) using the keywords retraction of articles, retraction notice, and withdrawal of article in January 2014, and analysis of articles published in 2012 and 2013 was carried out. Results: A total of 155 articles in 2012 and 182 in 2013 were retracted, and original articles followed by case reports constituted major part of it. The most cited reasons for retraction were mistakes, plagiarism, and duplicate submission, and the time interval between submission and retraction had reduced in 2013. Conclusion: Although retracted articles constitute the tip of an iceberg, they are still a matter of major concern in the scientific world. So, editors should follow the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and make an effective strategy in order to reduce such misconduct, as it reflects very adversely not only in the scientific community but also in the general public.", "Comments": "Table/Figure missing in this copy - check for updated one.", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.4103/2231-0762.151968", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Damineni Ravi Sankar, Sardiwal Kapil Kumar, Waghle Sita Ram, and Dakshyani MB (2015) A comprehensive comparative analysis of articles retracted in 2012 and 2013 from the scholarly literature.

Methods: Searches were performed to locate Internet copies of 1,779 retracted articles identified in MEDLINE, published between 1973 and 2010, excluding the publishers' website. Found copies were classified by article version and location. Mendeley (a bibliographic software) was searched for copies residing in personal libraries. Results: Non-publisher websites provided 321 publicly accessible copies for 289 retracted articles: 304 (95%) copies were the publisher' versions, and 13 (4%) were final manuscripts.

This study aimed to characterize cases of retraction within general and internal medicine in a high-profile database, with interest in the country of origin of the article and the impact factor (IF) of the journal in which the retraction was made. DESIGN AND SETTING: This study consisted of reviewing retraction notes in the Thomson-Reuters Web of Knowledge (WoK) indexing database, within general and internal medicine. METHODS: The retractions were classified as plagiarism/duplication, error, fraud and authorship problems and then aggregated into two categories: \"plagiarism/duplication\" and \"others.\" The countries of origin of the articles were dichotomized according to the median of the indicator \"citations per paper\" (CPP), and the IF was dichotomized according to its median within general and internal medicine, also obtained from the WoK database. These variables were analyzed using contingency tables according to CPP (high versus low), IF (high versus low) and period (1992-2002 versus 2003-2014). The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated for plagiarism/duplication. RESULTS: A total of 86 retraction notes were identified, and retraction reasons were found for 80 of them. The probability that plagiarism/duplication was the reason for retraction was more than three times higher for the low CPP group (RR: 3.4; 95% CI: [1.9-6.2]), and similar results were seen for the IF analysis.

These perceptions have been changing in the publication realm, particularly in the last 15 years. Presenting a brief overview of the literature, we address some of the conflicts that are likely to arise between authors and editors. We illustrate our approach with conference presentations that are later published as journal articles and focus on a recent retraction of an article that had been previously published as a conference proceedings. Although we do not make definitive pronouncements on the matter-as many concepts are evolving-we do argue that conference papers that contain sufficient details for others to attempt a replication and are indexed in scientific databases such as PubMed, challenge some currently held assumptions of prior publication and originality in the sciences. Our view is that these important issues are in need of further clarification and harmonization within the science publishing community. This need is more evident when we consider current notions of research integrity when it comes to communication to peers. Revisiting long-standing views about what constitutes prior publication and developing a clearer set of guidelines for authors and editors to follow should reduce conflicts in the research environment, which already exerts considerable pressure, especially on newcomers in academia. However, while clearer guidelines are timely, developing them is only part of the challenge.

METHODS: All retractions published in 2008 were identified using the Medline publication type \"retraction of publication\". The notices of retraction and the original articles were retrieved. For each retraction, we identified the reason for retraction, the country of affiliation of the first author, the time to retraction, the impact factor of the journal and the mention of retraction on the original article. RESULTS: Overall, 244 retractions were considered for analysis. Formal retraction notices could not be retrieved for 9. Of the 235 retractions available (96%), the reason was not detailed for 21 articles (9%). The most cited reasons were mistakes (28%), plagiarism (20%), fraud (14%) and overlap (11%). The original paper or its location was found for 233 retractions (95%). Of these, 22% were available with no mention of the retraction. CONCLUSION: A standard retraction form could be helpful, with a check list of major reason, leaving the editor free to provide the reader with any further information. Original articles should remain available with a clear mention of the retraction.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1186/1756-0500-6-238 ", "Keywords": "Cross-Sectional Studies\r\nJournal Impact Factor\r\n*Retraction of Publication as Topic", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Decullier Evelyne, Huot Laure, Samson G\u00e9raldine, and Maisonneuve Herv\u00e9 (2013) Visibility of retractions: A cross-sectional one-year study.

We leverage descriptive statistics and ego-network methods to examine 4,871 retracted articles and their citations before and after retraction. Our retracted articles data was obtained from PubMed, Scopus, and Retraction Watch and their citing articles from Scopus. Our findings indicate a stark decrease in post-retraction citations and that most of these citations came from countries different from the retracted article's country of publication. Citation context analyses of a subset of retracted articles also reveal that post-retraction citations came from articles with disciplinary and geographical boundaries different from that of the retracted article.

Despite wide knowledge of the gaming of such metrics, in particular the Clarivate Analytics journal impact factor (JIF), no suitable substitute concept has yet emerged, nor has any corrective measure been developed. In a post-publication peer review world of increasing retractions, and within a framework of open science, we propose correction factors for JBMs and ABMs that take into account retractions. We describe ways to correct the JIF, CiteScore, the 5-year Impact Factor, Immediacy Index, Cited Half-Life, Raw Impact per Paper and other JBMs (Eigenfactor Score and Article Influence Score) as well as the h-index, one of the most widespread ABMs, depending on the number of retractions for that journal or individual, respectively. The existence of such corrective factors could make the use of these metrics more transparent, and might allow them to be used in a world that is adapting to an increase in retractions and corrective measures to deal with erroneous scientific literature.

To curb this problem, the Indian government has initiated a number of measures, such as providing plagiarism detecting software to all the universities for free. Still, however, many unfair or incorrect papers are published. For some time, publishers have used an efficient tool to deal with such situations: retractions. A published paper that is later discovered to not deserve publicationwhich can be for a number of reasonscan be withdrawn (and often removed from the online contents of the journal) by the publisher. This study aims (1) to identify retracted publications authored orco-authored by researchers affiliated to Indian institutions and (2) to analyze the reasons for the retractions. To meet these aims, we searched the SCOPUS database to identify retraction notices for articles authored or coauthored by Indian authors. The first retraction notice was issued back in 1996, an exceptionally early retraction, as the next one was published in 2005. Thus, we analyzed 239 retractions (195 from journals and 44 from conference proceedings) published between 2005 and 3 August 2018 (but most were published after 2010), in terms of the following qualitative retraction-wise parameters: the main reason for retraction, authorship, a collaboration level, collaborating countries, sources of retraction (a journal or conference proceedings), and funding sources of the research. We also detected journals with high retraction frequencies. Mainly two phrasesRetraction notice to and Retracted Articlewere used to retract publications.

DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional study. POPULATION: 88 articles (18 journals) by the anaesthesiologist Dr. Boldt, that warranted retraction. METHOD: According to the recommendations of the Committee on Publication Ethics, we regarded a retraction as adequate when a retraction notice was published, linked to the retracted article, identified the title and authors of the retracted article in its heading, explained the reason and who took responsibility for the retraction, and when the retracted article was freely accessible and marked using a transparent watermark that preserved original content. Two authors extracted data independently (January 2013) and contacted editors-in-chief and publishers for clarification in cases of inadequate retraction. RESULTS: Five articles (6%) fulfilled all criteria for adequate retraction. Nine (10%) were not retracted (no retraction notice published, full text article not marked). 79 (90%) retraction notices were published, 76 (86%) were freely accessible, but only 15 (17%) were complete. 73 (83%) full text articles were marked as retracted, of which 14 (16%) had an opaque watermark hiding parts of the original content, and 11 (13%) had all original content deleted. 59 (67%) retracted articles were freely accessible. One editor-in-chief stated personal problems as a reason for incomplete retractions, eight blamed their publishers. Two publishers cited legal threats from Dr. Boldt's co-authors which prevented them from retracting articles. CONCLUSION: Guidelines for retracting articles are incompletely followed. The role of publishers in the retraction process needs to be clarified and standards are needed on marking retracted articles. It remains unclear who should check that retractions are done properly. Legal safeguards are required to allow retraction of articles against the wishes of authors.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0085846 ", "Keywords": "Biomedical Research/ethics/*standards\r\nEditorial Policies\r\nHumans\r\nPeriodicals as Topic/ethics/*standards\r\nPublishing/ethics/*standards\r\n*Retraction of Publication as Topic\r\nScientific Misconduct/ethics/statistics & numerical data", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Elia Nadia, Wager Elizabeth, and Tram\u00e8r Martin R (2014) Fate of articles that warranted retraction due to ethical concerns: A descriptive cross-sectional study.

Researchers whose work raises doubts about the safety of certain vaccines claim to be victims of discriminatory treatment aimed at suppressing dissent, including the unjustified retraction of their published research. Such practices have previously been discussed in other controversial fields in science (e.g., AIDS, the environment, and water fluoridation) but not in the field of vaccines. The purpose of this study was to analyze, for the first time, the subjective views of researchers whose papers were retracted. Study participants are active researchers, most with international reputations in their respective fields. They perceived retraction as a means of censoring and silencing critical voices with the aim of preserving the pro-vaccination agenda of interested parties. Participants also reported additional measures aimed at harming them personally and professionally. These findings point to the need for a fair, open, and honest discourse about the safety of vaccines for the benefit of public health and the restoration of trust in science and medicine. \u00a9 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.", "Comments": "Export Date: 10 February 2021 | CODEN: CPHRC", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1080/09581596.2021.1878109", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Elisha Ety, Guetzkow Josh, Shir-Raz Yaffa, and Ronel Natti (2021) Retraction of scientific papers: the case of vaccine research [Online First].

The validity of the OSI including and excluding quotations and references and the HSS in predicting the potential reasons for retraction were tested using the receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: Of the total 138 retracted original and corresponding articles identified, 131 articles were analyzed. Most of them had the HSS more than 40% arising from a single source. Extensive degree of plagiarism (OSI score >35%) was identified through the main text of all analyzed retracted articles. The areas under the curves indicate that the OSI including and excluding quotations and bibliography and the HSS had reasonable ability to predict plagiarism and fabrication with a perfect sensitivity rate and low specificity but were weaker at distinguishing ethical misconduct or inconsistent or erroneous contents. Conclusions: The study highlights the presence of significant plagiarism in the retracted anesthesia publications irrespective to the reasons for retraction.

Some OAMJs charge hefty (exceeding US$1000) article processing fees. One characteristic of OAMJs is a large editorial board. In 2015, Bj\u00f6rk indicated that a primary characteristic of an OAMJ was its prepublication soundness only peer review, i.e., novelty, significance, relevance and impact are assessed only post-publication. However, such a premise ignores the inherent nature of peers\u2019 bias. This controversial claim is challenged in this paper by assessing whether there is a link between research output (number of papers published in each OAMJ) and number of errata, including retractions. We assessed 16 OAMJs indexed in Clarivate Analytics\u2019 Web of Science and found wide variation in published errata and retractions across OAMJs between 2012 and 2018. PLOS ONE had the highest correction rate (3.159%), followed by Medicine (3.158%), BMJ Open (2.949%) and Scientific Reports (2.896%). In contrast, PeerJ, Elementa, and Science of the Anthropocene did not publish any errata in 2012\u20132018 but IEEE Access had a correction rate of 0.059%. Regarding the retraction rate, the highest share of retracted publications was seen in Medicine (0.079%), Cell Reports (0.035%) and PLOS ONE (0.030%), while nine out of the 16 studied OAMJs did not have any retracted publications during 2012\u20132018. We conclude that there is wide variation in \u201cquality control\u201d, as assessed through errata and retractions, among OAMJs. We recommend, therefore, that the \u201csoundness only peer review\u201d prerequisite for OAMJs should be scrapped.", "Comments": "Export Date: 28 January 2021", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03153-5", "Keywords": "Article processing charge\r\nJournal cascading\r\nOA\r\nOAMJ\r\nPost-publication peer review", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Erfanmanesh Mohammadamin, and Teixeira da Silva Jaime A (2019) Is the soundness-only quality control policy of open access mega journals linked to a higher rate of published errors?.

METHODS: We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed), PubMed Central, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases for dental retracted articles from database inception to 02 July 2018. In addition, we scanned the search engine Google Scholar, and the website, Retraction Watch (www.retractionwatch.com), for retracted dental articles. Two researchers independently screened titles, abstracts and full text of search results. Descriptive data was collected on each retracted article including reason for retraction, study type, journal impact factor, and time between publication and retraction. Regression models were used to evaluate the association between journal impact factor and retraction characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 138 retractions of dental articles were included. Reasons for retraction were misconduct (N = 100, 72.5%), with the most frequently reported misconduct being overlap/plagiarism and innacurate/falsified conducting and reporting (N = 53, 38.4%). In vitro (N = 39, 28.3%), case reports (N = 29, 21%) and narrative reviews (N = 19, 13.8%) were study design most frequently identified in retracted articles. The median time between article publication and date of retraction notice was 1 year (interquartile-range [IQR] = 0-2 years). More than half of the retracted articles (n = 82, 59.4%) were cited post-retraction. A retracted article reporting a randomized controlled trial was more likely to appear in journal with higher impact factor than a retracted case report (mean difference [MD] = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2,3.1. Articles retracted after 2012 were likely to appear in journals with a lower impact factor (MD=-1.3; 95%CI=-1.8, 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Research misconduct is the main reason for retraction of dental articles. A substantial proportion of these articles were still being cited after their retraction. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This report of dental retraction articles informs that more transparency is needed with data reporting in dentistry to improve writing practices in dentistry. A more complete report of retractions and their causes would provide more accurate information to inform researchers and editors to avoid or reduce future cases of retractions. More complete and accurate reporting would increase the overall trust in dental research.", "Comments": "systematic review", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2018.09.002 ", "Keywords": "Journal Impact Factor\r\n*Plagiarism\r\n*Publishing\r\nResearch Design\r\n*Scientific Misconduct\r\n*Conflict of interest\r\n*Ethics\r\n*Retracted publication\r\n*Retraction of publication", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Faggion Cl\u00f3vis Mariano Jr, Ware Robert S, Bakas Nikolaos, and Wasiak Jason (2018) An analysis of retractions of dental publications.

Belief in the importance of these factors has inspired major policy initiatives, but evidence to support them is either non-existent or derived from self-reports and other sources that have known limitations. We used a retrospective study design to verify whether risk factors for scientific misconduct could predict the occurrence of retractions, which are usually the consequence of research misconduct, or corrections, which are honest rectifications of minor mistakes. Bibliographic and personal information were collected on all co-authors of papers that have been retracted or corrected in 2010-2011 (N=611 and N=2226 papers, respectively) and authors of control papers matched by journal and issue (N=1181 and N=4285 papers, respectively), and were analysed with conditional logistic regression. Results, which avoided several limitations of past studies and are robust to different sampling strategies, support the notion that scientific misconduct is more likely in countries that lack research integrity policies, in countries where individual publication performance is rewarded with cash, in cultures and situations were mutual criticism is hampered, and in the earliest phases of a researcher\u2019s career. The hypothesis that males might be prone to scientific misconduct was not supported, and the widespread belief that pressures to publish are a major driver of misconduct was largely contradicted: high-impact and productive researchers, and those working in countries in which pressures to publish are believed to be higher, are less-likely to produce retracted papers, and more likely to correct them. Efforts to reduce and prevent misconduct, therefore, might be most effective if focused on promoting research integrity policies, improving mentoring and training, and encouraging transparent communication amongst researchers.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0127556", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Fanelli Daniele, Costas Rodrigo, and Larivi\u00e8re Vincent (2015) Misconduct policies, academic culture and career stage, not gender or pressures to publish, affect scientific integrity.

The results obtained indicate that the number of ethical implications per case has not changed significantly (p > 0.01) since the year COPE was instigated. Interestingly, the number of ethical cases, and to some extent, research misconduct, is not diminishing. Therefore, journal editors and publishers need to work closely together with COPE to inculcate adoption of appropriate research ethics and values in younger researchers while discouraging others from lowering standards. It is hoped that with a more concerted effort from the academic community and better public awareness, there will be fewer incidences of ethically and scientifically challenged publications. The ultimate aim being to enhance the quality of published works with concomittant public trust in the results.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-011-9273-3", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Foo Jong Yong Abdiel, and Wilson Stephen James (2012) An analysis on the research ethics cases Managed by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) Between 1997 and 2010.

Sadly, the lingering effect of such behavior is translated into research misconduct where the scientific community is misled and the confidence of the general public in research being shaken. High-profile cases such as that involving the stem cell researcher, Hwang Woo-Suk, have lasting detrimental effects on himself as well as his home country. For developed nations like Singapore, a large percentage of its annual gross domestic product is invested in research. Between the year 2004 and 2010, a total of 2,427 journal publications were affiliated to an institution in Singapore were extracted from the PubMed database. The retraction data indicated that only 9 or 0.4% of these publications were tainted. The obtained publication trend of the authors associated with these tainted publications was then examined up to-date. It is worth highlighting that the numbers herein may be just a tip of the iceberg of the actual number of tainted publications. In this chapter, the possible implications of research misconduct such as the lasting effects of unpunished offences, the need to promote whistle-blowing and the necessity for a unique author's identity are discussed. \u00a9 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Through two pilot case studies, we demonstrate how the keystone framework can be applied to knowledge maintenance tasks for digital libraries, including addressing citations of a non-reproducible paper and identifying statements most needing validation in a high-impact paper.

While research errors are as relevant to the knowledge economy as defects are to the manufacturing economy, mechanisms to identify and signal \"defective\" or false knowledge are poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate one such institution - the system of scientific retractions. We analyze the universe of peer-reviewed scientific articles retracted from the biomedical literature between 1972-2006 and comparing with a matched control sample in order to identify the correlates, timing, and causal impact of scientific retractions. This effort provides insight into the workings of a distributed, peer-based system for the governance of validity in scientific knowledge. Our findings suggest that attention is a key predictor of retraction - retracted articles arise most frequently among highly-cited articles. The retraction system is expeditious in uncovering knowledge that is ever determined to be false (the mean time to retraction is less than two years) and democratic (retraction is not systematically affected by author prominence). Lastly, retraction causes an immediate, severe, and long-lived decline in future citations. Conditional on the obvious limitation that we cannot measure the absolute amount of false science in circulation, these results support the view that distributed governance systems can be designed to uncover false knowledge relatively swiftly and to mitigate the costs that false knowledge for future generations of producers.

Scientists who commit research misconduct typically face corrective actions from employers and funding agencies, as well as significant professional stigma. Unfortunately, there is little systematic data about the post-misconduct career of these guilty parties. Through a review of Office of Research Integrity (ORI) case summaries, I identified a pool of 284 researchers who engaged in research misconduct and were subject to ORI corrective actions. To assess the prevalence of post-misconduct research activities for these scientists, I searched publicly available databases and online resources for evidence of post-misconduct research activities (such as publications and federal research support). The data demonstrate that researchers often receive second chances as researchers, with indicators of post-misconduct research activities identified for 134 (47.18%) of the offending researchers.

Methods We conducted searches through PubMed to retrieve errata, duplicate, and retracted publications (as of January 30, 2014). To analyze publication activity and citation profiles of countries, multidisciplinary, and specialized biomedical journals, we referred to the latest data from the SCImago Journal & Country Rank database. Total number of indexed articles and values of the h-index of the fifty most productive countries and multidisciplinary journals were recorded and linked to the number of duplicate and retracted publications in PubMed. Results Our analysis found 2597 correction items. A striking increase in the number of corrections appeared in 2013, which is mainly due to 871 (85.3%) corrections from PLOS One. The number of duplicate publications was 1086. Articles frequently published in duplicate were reviews (15.6%), original studies (12.6%), and case reports (7.6%), whereas top three retracted articles were original studies (10.1%), randomized trials (8.8%), and reviews (7%). A strong association existed between the total number of publications across countries and duplicate (r(s) = 0.86, P < 0.001) and retracted items (r(s) = 0.812, P < 0.001). A similar trend was found between country-based h-index values and duplicate and retracted publications.

Changes in public sentiment have the potential to either drive or limit investment in publicly funded activities, such as scientific research. As a result, understanding the ways in which reported cases of scientific misconduct shape public sentiment is becoming increasingly essential-for researchers and institutions, as well as for policy makers and funders. In this study, we thus set out to assess and define the patterns according to which public sentiment may change in response to reported cases of scientific misconduct. This study focuses on the public response to the events involved in a recent case of major scientific misconduct that occurred in 2014 in Japan-stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP) cell case. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine (1) the patterns according to which public sentiment changes in response to scientific misconduct; (2) whether such measures vary significantly, coincident with major timeline events; and (3) whether the changes observed mirror the response patterns reported in the literature with respect to other classes of events, such as entertainment news and disaster reports. METHODS: The recent STAP cell scandal is used as a test case. Changes in the volume and polarity of discussion were assessed using a sampling of case-related Twitter data, published between January 28, 2014 and March 15, 2015. Rapidminer was used for text processing and the popular bag-of-words algorithm, SentiWordNet, was used in Rapidminer to calculate sentiment for each sample Tweet. Relative volume and sentiment was then assessed overall, month-to-month, and with respect to individual entities. RESULTS: Despite the ostensibly negative subject, average sentiment over the observed period tended to be neutral (-0.04); however, a notable downward trend (y=-0.01 x +0.09; R =.45) was observed month-to-month. Notably polarized tweets accounted for less than one-third of sampled discussion: 17.49% (1656/9467) negative and 12.59% positive (1192/9467). Significant polarization was found in only 4 out of the 15 months covered, with significant variation month-to-month (P<.001). Significant increases in polarization tended to coincide with increased discussion volume surrounding major events (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that public opinion toward scientific research may be subject to the same sensationalist dynamics driving public opinion in other, consumer-oriented topics. The patterns in public response observed here, with respect to the STAP cell case, were found to be consistent with those observed in the literature with respect to other classes of news-worthy events on Twitter. Discussion was found to become strongly polarized only during times of increased public attention, and such increases tended to be driven primarily by negative reporting and reactionary commentary.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.2196/publichealth.5980", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Gayle Alberto, and Shimaoka Motomu (2017) Public response to scientific misconduct: Assessing changes in public sentiment toward the Stimulus-Triggered Acquisition of Pluripotency (STAP) cell Case via Twitter.

All rights reserved.Objective To calculate the number of scientific articles published but later retracted, to analyse the reasons for the retractions, and to compare the results with those from EU countries comparable to Croatia in terms of expenditure on R&D and the number of active researchers. Methods We searched for retracted articles published between 1990 and 2017, with at least one Croatian author, indexed by the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS CC) and identified those that had been retracted (as ascertained from the Retraction Watch database). The number of such articles was compared to the number similarly arrived at for three other EU countries. The retraction notices of the Croatian articles were scrutinized to determine the date and the reasons for retraction. Results Of the 17 articles the retraction of which could be verified in the original source and/or from a retraction notice, four had been published in Croatian journals. The time from publication to retraction ranged from one month to nine years. Most such articles belonged to the field of biomedicine, and more than a half were retracted because of scientific misconduct (plagiarism and redundant or duplicate publication).

Design: An audit of retraction notices associated with 29 retracted manuscripts published in nursing science journals. Methods: Retraction notices were reviewed again using the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines. Results: In total, 28 retraction notices were retrieved and reviewed (one retracted paper did not have a retraction notice). Details of the retracted manuscripts were included in all reviewed notices and, in all but two, author names were reported. Details of the time between a paper being published and retracted were not reported and generally there was a little information in notices about how the retraction decisions were made. All retraction notices were freely available. Seven notices stated who had made the decision to retract. Twenty-two (77%) notices stated the reason for retraction.

Moreover, the post-exoneration attitude toward the researcher was similar in the exoneration and the control conditions.

Concerns have been expressed about the objectivity, adequacy and transparency of institutional investigations of potentially compromised research integrity. We assessed the reports provided to us of investigations by three academic institutions of a large body of overlapping research with potentially compromised integrity. Methods: In 2017, we raised concerns with four academic institutions about the integrity of > 200 publications coauthored by an overlapping set of researchers. Each institution initiated an investigation. By November 2018, three had reported to us the results of their investigations, but only one report was publicly available. Two investigators independently assessed each available report using a published 26-item checklist designed to determine the quality and adequacy of institutional investigations of research integrity. Each assessor recorded additional comments ad hoc. Results: Concerns raised with the institutions were overlapping, wide-ranging and included those which were both general and publication-specific. The number of potentially affected publications at individual institutions ranged from 34 to 200. The duration of investigation by the three institutions which provided reports was 8\u201317 months. These investigations covered 14%, 15% and 77%, respectively, of potentially affected publications. Between-assessor agreement using the quality checklist was 0.68, 0.72 and 0.65 for each report. Only 4/78 individual checklist items were addressed adequately: a further 14 could not be assessed. Each report was graded inadequate overall. Reports failed to address publication-specific concerns and focussed more strongly on determining research misconduct than evaluating the integrity of publications. Conclusions: Our analyses identify important deficiencies in the quality and reporting of institutional investigation of concerns about the integrity of a large body of research reported by an overlapping set of researchers. They reinforce disquiet about the ability of institutions to rigorously and objectively oversee integrity of research conducted by their own employees.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-019-0062-x", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Grey Andrew, Bolland Mark J, Gamble Greg D, and Avenell Alison (2019) Quality of reports of investigations of research integrity by academic institutions.

Past surveys of the retracted literature each limited their scope to articles in PubMed, though many retracted articles are not indexed in PubMed. To understand the scope and characteristics of retracted articles across the full spectrum of scholarly disciplines, we surveyed 42 of the largest bibliographic databases for major scholarly fields and publisher websites to identify retracted articles. This study examines various trends among them. RESULTS: We found, 4,449 scholarly publications retracted from 1928-2011. Unlike Math, Physics, Engineering and Social Sciences, the percentages of retractions in Medicine, Life Science and Chemistry exceeded their percentages among Web of Science (WoS) records. Retractions due to alleged publishing misconduct (47%) outnumbered those due to alleged research misconduct (20%) or questionable data/interpretations (42%). This total exceeds 100% since multiple justifications were listed in some retraction notices. Retraction/WoS record ratios vary among author affiliation countries. Though widespread, only miniscule percentages of publications for individual years, countries, journals, or disciplines have been retracted. Fifteen prolific individuals accounted for more than half of all retractions due to alleged research misconduct, and strongly influenced all retraction characteristics. The number of articles retracted per year increased by a factor of 19.06 from 2001 to 2010, though excluding repeat offenders and adjusting for growth of the published literature decreases it to a factor of 11.36. CONCLUSIONS: Retracted articles occur across the full spectrum of scholarly disciplines. Most retracted articles do not contain flawed data; and the authors of most retracted articles have not been accused of research misconduct. Despite recent increases, the proportion of published scholarly literature affected by retraction remains very small. Articles and editorials discussing retractions, or their relation to research integrity, should always consider individual cases in these broad contexts. However, better mechanisms are still needed for raising researchers' awareness of the retracted literature in their field.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0044118 ", "Keywords": "Data Collection\r\n*PubMed\r\n*Publishing", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Grieneisen Michael L, and Zhang Minghua (2012) A comprehensive survey of retracted articles from the scholarly literature.

Methods: We conducted an e-survey using a cloud-based website to gauge the potential sources of trustworthy information and misinformation and analyzed researchers', clinicians', and academics' attitude toward unpublished items, and pre- and post-publication quality checks in this challenging time. Results: Among 128 respondents (mean age, 43.2 years; M:F, 1.1:1), 60 (46.9%) were scholarly journal editors and editorial board members. Social media channels were distinguished as the most important sources of information as well as misinformation (81 [63.3%] and 86 [67.2%]). Nearly two in five (62, 48.4%) respondents blamed reviewers, editors, and misinterpretation by readers as additional contributors alongside authors for misinformation. A higher risk of plagiarism was perceived by the majority (70, 58.6%), especially plagiarism of ideas (64.1%) followed by inappropriate paraphrasing (54.7%). Opinion was divided on the utility of preprints for changing practice and changing retraction rates during the pandemic period, and higher rejections were not supported by most (76.6%) while the importance of peer review was agreed upon by a majority (80, 62.5%). More stringent screening by journal editors (61.7%), and facilitating open access plagiarism software (59.4%), including Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms (43.8%) were among the suggested solutions. Most (74.2%) supported the need to launch a specialist bibliographic database for COVID-19, with information indexed (62.3%), available as open-access (82.8%), after expanding search terms (52.3%) and following due verification by academics (66.4%), and journal editors (52.3%). Conclusion: While identifying social media as a potential source of misinformation on COVID-19, and a perceived high risk of plagiarism, more stringent peer review and skilled post-publication promotion are advisable.

For Objective #1, all 5 articles to be Retracted were retracted and of the 4 to be Corrected, 2 were Retracted and 2 were Corrected. Eight PubMed and journal sites were identified where retraction messages could be conveyed; the number of retraction messages averaged 3.4+2.5 for these 9 articles. For Objective #2, an absolute \"cleansing\" did not occur. While it initially appears there was a relative \"cleansing\", as citation rates for these articles did decrease after retraction, the reductions in citation rates for these articles (-28%) were the same as those for matched non-retracted publications both by the same author (-28%) and by another investigator (-29%) over the same time frame. Relative to Objective #3, the results for this case are quite different from the 5 other cases assessing this issue, perhaps because of this investigator's \"citation inertia\" as a result of the small percentage of hisr papers that were retracted and the large number of citations to the articles prior to their retraction and to all of his published articles.", "Comments": " (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00003.2020", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Hagberg James M (2020) The unfortunately long life of some retracted biomedical research publications.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A list of previously identified retracted articles within the field of radiation oncology was updated in June 2017. The number of publications citing retracted articles was quantified using Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus. Studies citing retracted publications after publication of the retraction note were individually assessed to determine the nature of the reference. RESULTS: Forty-seven retracted articles were identified for this study. Thirty-seven studies (79%) received 1017 citations before retraction, and 34 articles (72%) received 407 English and 169 foreign-language citations afterward. The average number of citations dropped from 22 to 11 after publication of the retraction note (95% confidence interval, 0.3-21.0, P = .043). Most postretraction citations occurred during the second year after the article's retraction, originated from North America and Asia (N = 124 each, 31%) and Europe (N = 122, 30%), and featured in original articles (N = 254, 62%) and reviews (N = 73, 18%). Of the 358 individually evaluable citing studies, 92% referenced the retracted article as legitimate work. Three guidelines and 15 systematic reviews and meta-analyses were also identified that cited retracted articles as valid work. CONCLUSIONS: Postretraction citations are an avoidable phenomenon. The results of the study emphasize the need for investigators to adhere to good research practices to mitigate the influence and propagation of flawed and unethical research. Journal editors, peer reviewers, and the broader radiation oncology readership should remain diligent in ensuring that citations of retracted work are identified and removed before, during, and possibly even after publication.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2018.11.014 ", "Keywords": "Confidence Intervals\r\nRadiation Oncology/*statistics & numerical data\r\n*Retraction of Publication as Topic", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Hamilton Daniel George (2019) Continued citation of retracted radiation oncology literature-do we have a problem?.

Our analysis echoes the pioneering research of STS scholar Mario Biagioli, who argues that our academic culture is shifting from \"publish or perish\" to \"impact or perish.\" Getting a good score on the metrics of academic evaluation becomes the goal of some scholars, leading to the emergency of postproduction misconduct. As revealed in the BMC retraction incident, commercial agencies that claimed to be able to facilitate academic publishing manipulated the peer-review process of academic papers by fabricating their peer reviews to help some clinicians meet the requirements of the title assessment system. This article advances Biagioli's argument by expounding on the following two characteristics of the BMC retraction incident: first, peer reviews were fabricated by agencies instead of the authors themselves; second, the incident was induced systematically by the title assessment system, instead of particularly by individual factors of the authors. Through analyzing this case, we obtain important insight into postproduction misconduct, which is beneficial to more thoroughly understanding and then mitigating this new type of academic misconduct.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1215/18752160-4275144", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Han Junhui, and Li Zhengfeng (2018) How metrics-based academic evaluation could systematically induce academic misconduct: A case study.

The data and services used are all open and free to foster the reproducibility of the analysis. The outcomes concerned the analysis of the entities citing Wakefield et al.\u2019s article and their related in-text citations. We observed a constant increasing number of citations in the last 20\u00a0years, accompanied with a constant increment in the percentage of those acknowledging its retraction. Citing articles have started either discussing or dealing with the retraction of Wakefield et al.\u2019s article even before its full retraction happened in 2010. Articles in the social sciences domain citing the Wakefield et al.\u2019s one were among those that have mostly discussed its retraction. In addition, when observing the in-text citations, we noticed that a large number of the citations received by Wakefield et al.\u2019s article has focused on general discussions without recalling strictly medical details, especially after the full retraction.

Anesthesiology journals are affected not only by ghostwriting and plagiarism but also by counterfeiting. In the present study 20 publications in anesthesiology known to be falsified by an author were investigated for irregularities with respect to Benford's law using the chi(2)-test and the Z-test. In the 20 retracted publications an average first-digit frequency of 243.1 (standard deviation SD +/- 118.2, range: 30-592) and an average second-digit frequency of 132.3 (SD +/- 72.2, range: 15-383) were found. The observed distribution of the first and second digits to the left of the decimal point differed significantly (p< 0.01) from the expected distribution described by Benford. Only the observed absolute frequencies for digits 3, 4 and 5 did not differ significantly from the expected values. In an analysis of each paper 17 out of 20 studies differed significantly from the expected value for the first digit and 18 out of 20 studies varied significantly from the expected value of the second digit. Only one paper did not vary significantly from expected values for the digits to the left of the decimal. For comparison, a meta-analysis using complex mathematical procedures was chosen as a control. The analysis showed a first-digit distribution consistent with the Benford distribution. Thus, the method used in the present study seems to be sensitive for detecting fraud.

This corresponds to high levels of acceptance of sanctions in the scientific community, but a low acceptance of the respective authorities.

Although peer review's ability to filter out such publications is contentious, several peer review innovations attempt to do just that. However, there is very little systematic evidence documenting the ability of different review procedures to flag problematic publications. In this article, we use survey data on peer review in a wide range of journals to compare the retraction rates of specific review procedures, using the Retraction Watch database. We were able to identify which peer review procedures were used since 2000 for 361 journals, publishing a total of 833,172 articles, of which 670 were retracted. After addressing the dual character of retractions, signalling both a failure to identify problems prior to publication, but also the willingness to correct mistakes, we empirically assess review procedures. With considerable conceptual caveats, we were able to identify peer review procedures that seem able to detect problematic research better than others. Results were verified for disciplinary differences and variation between reasons for retraction. This leads to informed recommendations for journal editors about strengths and weaknesses of specific peer review procedures, allowing them to select review procedures that address issues most relevant to their field.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-018-2969-2", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Horbach SPJM, and Halffman W (2019) The ability of different peer review procedures to flag problematic publications.

We identified retraction notes that unambiguously reported an honest error and that had been published between the years 2010 and 2015. We limited our sample to retractions with at least one co-author based in the Netherlands, Belgium, United Kingdom, Germany or a Scandinavian country, and we invited these authors to a semi-structured interview. Fourteen authors accepted our invitation. Contrary to our initial assumptions, most of our interviewees had not originally intended to retract their paper. They had contacted the journal to request a correction and the decision to retract had been made by journal editors. All interviewees reported that having to retract their own publication made them concerned for their scientific reputation and career, often causing considerable stress and anxiety. Interviewees also encountered difficulties in communicating with the journal and recalled other procedural issues that had unnecessarily slowed down the process of self-retraction. Intriguingly, however, all interviewees reported how, contrary to their own expectations, the self-retraction had brought no damage to their reputation and in some cases had actually improved it. We also examined the ethical motivations that interviewees ascribed, retrospectively, to their actions and found that such motivations included a combination of moral and prudential (i.e. pragmatic) considerations.

Furthermore, the hard-discipline RNs authored by journal authorities identified agents of culpable acts significantly less frequently and less explicitly than both the hard-discipline RNs from authors of retracted publications and the soft-discipline RNs written by journal authorities did.

Of the 111 articles (addressing the retraction of 114 papers), 58.8% were issued by the authors, 17.5% were jointly issued (author, editor, and publisher), 15.8% came from editors, and 4.4% were dispatched by institutions; in 5.3% of the instances, the issuer was unstated. The reasons for retraction included duplicate publication (57.0%), plagiarism (8.8%), scientific error (4.4%), author dispute (3.5%), and other (5.3%); the reasons were unstated or unclear in 20.2%. The degree of adherence to COPE's retraction guidelines varied (79.8%-100%), and some retractions were inappropriate by COPE standards. These were categorized as follows: retraction of the first published article in the case of duplicate publication (69.2%), authorship dispute (15.4%), errata (7.7%), and other (7.7%). Conclusion The major reason for retraction in Korean medical journals is duplicate publication. Some retractions resulted from overreaction by the editors. Therefore, editors of Korean medical journals should take careful note of the COPE retraction guidelines and should undergo training on appropriate retraction practices.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0163588", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Huh Sun, Kim Soo Young, and Cho Hye-Min (2016) Characteristics of retractions from Korean medical journals in the KoreaMed database: A bibliometric analysis.

Previous and anecdotal evidence suggests that these reach far beyond the fraudulent scientist and (his or) her career, affecting coauthors and institutions. Here we show that the negative effects of scientific misconduct spill over to uninvolved prior collaborators: compared to a control group, prior collaborators of misconducting scientists, who have no connection to the misconduct case, are cited 8\u20139% less often afterwards. We suggest that the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is stigmatization by mere association. The result suggests that scientific misconduct generates large indirect costs in the form of mistrust towards a wider range of research findings than was previously assumed.

This, however, raises the question of how to assign accountability for scientific misconduct among larger teams of authors. Biomedical societies and science associations have put forward various sets of guidelines. Some state that all authors are jointly accountable for the integrity of the work. Others stipulate that authors are only accountable for their own contribution. Alternatively, there are guarantor type models that assign accountability to a single author. We contribute to this debate by analyzing the outcomes of 80 scientific misconduct investigations of biomedical scholars conducted by the U.S. Office of Research Integrity (ORI). We show that the position of authors on the byline of 184 publications involved in misconduct cases correlates with responsibility for the misconduct. Based on a series of binary regression models, we show that first authors are 38% more likely to be responsible for scientific misconduct than authors listed in the middle of the byline (p<0.01). Corresponding authors are 14% more likely (p<0.05). These findings suggest that a guarantor-like model where first authors are ex-ante accountable for misconduct is highly likely to not miss catching the author responsible, while not afflicting too many bystanders.", "Comments": "Export Date: 28 January 2021", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215962", "Keywords": "Authorship\r\nBiomedical Research\r\nScientific Misconduct\r\nSocial Responsibility\r\nUnited States\r\nUnited States Office of Research Integrity", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Hussinger K, and Pellens M (2019) Scientific misconduct and accountability in teams.

Thus citing authors, who cite the retracted articles in the negative context, are putting forth the argument against retracted article. Thus the retraction watches needs to revisit the list while deeming and ranking the retracted articles as highly cited. The retraction watch blog should incorporate the context in which the retracted articles were cited by the authors.

An integral part of this self-correction is the retraction notices identifying flawed scientific papers. Prevalence of retractions has been investigated in different countries and different scholarly disciplines, including surgery, biomedical sciences, and engineering. Reportedly retractions have increased with increasing number of papers from Iran. However, reasons underlying retractions of papers authored by the Iran-affiliated highly cited researchers (HCRs) have not been documented.\nResult Here, we report that 229 of the Iran-affiliated researchers were listed by the Clarivate Analytics as HCRs. In total, 51 retracted papers were authored by the HCRs as documented by the Retraction Watch Database interrogated from 2006 to 2019. Twenty-three of the 229 HCRs (10%) had at least one paper retracted. One of the listed HCRs had 22 papers retracted; 14 of the 23 (60.8%) had only one paper retracted. Of the 51 papers, 43 (84%) had a single retraction reason, whereas eight had multiple reasons. Among the 43 papers, 23 (53%) were retracted due to fake peer-review, eight (19%) were duplications, six (14%) had errors, four (9%) had plagiarism, and two (5%) were labelled as \u201climited or no information.\u201d Duplication of data, which is easily preventable, amounted to 27%. The time from publication to retraction of the 51 papers ranged from one to 2,483 (mean 856.6) days.\nConclusion Any publishing oversight committed by an HCR should not be tolerated because they represent the stakeholders of the scientific literature and stand as role-models for other peer researchers.

However, there are few studies of how leading journals are handling these issues. Therefore the purpose of this paper is to analyze the current situation and policies concerning academic dishonesty, plagiarism and paper retractions in academia in general, and business and economics disciplines in particular. Four databases, Ebsco Business Source Premier, Emerald, JSTOR and ScienceDirect, have been examined. This survey shows that while some science journals, e.g. medical journals, are very active in retracting papers due to the dishonesty and plagiarism, business and economics journals are not. The survey also displays that some journals have already published explicit policies regarding academic honesty; within the business field, however, only two established and one emerging journal discuss such policies. Given the extent of the problem, it seems important that more journals openly confront the situation, elaborate and publish explicit policies how to reduce the future occurrence of academic dishonesty and plagiarism.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "Keywords": "completed inclusion review\r\nLIMITED EMPIRICAL DATA\r\nsystematic reviews of retracted papers", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Karabag Solmaz Filiz, and Berggren Christian (2012) Retraction, dishonesty and plagiarism: Analysis of a crucial issue for academic publishing, and the inadequate responses from leading journals in economics and management disciplines.

DESIGN: Data was collected in three phases. First, all publicly retracted papers in MBE journals were identified through keywords searches in 7 major databases (n = 1329 journals). Second, a focused survey was distributed to editors involved in such retractions (n = 64; response rate = 28%). Finally, a survey was administered to all active journals in the seven databases to collect data on editors' perceptions and practices related to the two problems (n = 937, response rate = 31.8%). Frequency analyses, cross tabulations, and qualitative analyses of open answers were used to examine the data. RESULTS: 184 retracted papers in MBE journals were identified in 2005-2015 (no retraction was found before 2005). From 2005-2007 to 2012-2015, the number of retractions increased by a factor ten with an all-time high in 2015. The survey to journals with reported retractions illustrates how already a few cases of suspected misconduct put a strain on the editorial workload. The survey to all active journals revealed that 42% of the respondents had started to use software to screen all submitted papers, and that a majority recognized the problem of marginality, as indicated by salami-style submissions. According to some editors, reviewers easily spot such submissions whereas others argued that authors may submit thinly sliced papers in parallel to several journals, which means that this practice is only discovered post-publication. The survey question on ways to support creative contributions stimulated a rich response of ideas regarding editorial vision, engaged boards and developmental approaches. The study uses data from three specialized fields, but its findings may be highly relevant to many journals in the social sciences.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0159492 ", "Keywords": "Databases, Factual\r\nHumans\r\nPeriodicals as Topic/*standards\r\nPublishing\r\nRetraction of Publication as Topic\r\n*Scientific Misconduct\r\nSurveys and Questionnaires", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Karabag Solmaz Filiz, and Berggren Christian (2016) Misconduct, marginality and editorial practices in management, business and economics journals.

Data Sources: The Web of Science, PubMed, and Retraction Watch databases were searched from inception to August 2019. Study Selection: Retracted publications published in rehabilitation or sport sciences journals, indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) and Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) were included. Data Extraction: One author extracted the data. Two other authors checked the data. Data Synthesis: A total of 37 and 52 retracted publications and their retraction notices were identified for rehabilitation and sport sciences, respectively. The majority of retracted publications (68% of all retracted papers in rehabilitation and 54% of all retracted papers in sport sciences) were published in the past decade. Retracted publications in rehabilitation and sport sciences were published in 21 and 22 different journals and originated from 18 and 21 different countries, respectively. The full-text of the retracted publications was available with a retraction watermark or note for 59% of cases in rehabilitation and 58% in sport sciences. The reasons for the retractions were more often attributed to misconduct (79% and 61%) than to honest error (21% and 39%) in rehabilitation and sport sciences, respectively. However, a reason was not stated for 15% of the publications. The median time interval between publication and retraction was 622 days in rehabilitation and 607 days in sport sciences publications. Conclusions: The total number of retracted publications in rehabilitation and sport sciences journals was small.

The present article aims to assess the requirements of health policy and services journals for authors to disclose their financial and non-financial COIs. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of journals listed by the Web of Science under the category of 'Health Policy and Services'. We reviewed the 'Instructions for Authors' on the journals' websites and then simulated the submission of a manuscript to obtain any additional relevant information made available during that step. We abstracted data in duplicate and independently using a standardised form. RESULTS: Out of 72 eligible journals, 67 (93%) had a COI policy. A minority of policies described how the disclosed COIs of authors would impact the editorial process (34%). None of the policies had clear-cut criteria for rejection based on the content of the disclosure. Approximately a fifth of policies (21%) explicitly stated that inaccurate or incomplete disclosures might lead to manuscript rejection or retraction. No policy described whether the journal would verify the accuracy or completeness of authors' disclosed COIs. Most journals' policies (93%) required the disclosure of at least one form of financial COI. While the majority asked for specification of source of payment (71%), a minority asked for the amount (18%). Overall, 81% of policies explicitly required disclosure of non-financial COIs. CONCLUSION: A majority of health policy and services journal policies required the disclosure of authors' financial and non-financial COIs, but few required details on disclosed COIs. Health policy journals should provide specific definitions and instructions for disclosing non-financial COIs. A framework providing clear typology and operational definitions of the different types of COIs will facilitate both their disclosure by authors and reviewers and their assessment and management by the editorial team and the readers.", "Comments": "\"Approximately a fifth of policies (21%) explicitly stated that inaccurate or incomplete disclosures might lead to manuscript rejection or retraction.\" - and see supplement", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-017-0244-2 ", "Keywords": "*Conflict of Interest\r\nCross-Sectional Studies\r\n*Disclosure\r\n*Health Policy\r\nHumans\r\n*Periodicals as Topic", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Khamis Assem M, Hakoum Maram B, Bou-Karroum Lama, Habib Joseph R, Ali Ahmed, Guyatt Gordon, El-Jardali Fadi, and Akl Elie A (2017) Requirements of health policy and services journals for authors to disclose financial and non-financial conflicts of interest: a cross-sectional study.

Results: The 114 retracted articles were found in KoreaMed. The proportion of retracted articles in KoreaMed, the Korean medical journal database, through January 2016 was 0.04% (114/256,000). On the journal homepage, a retraction mark was present for 49 of the 114 retracted articles. Of the 114 retracted articles, 45 were cited in Scopus 176 times. Of the 176 citations, 109 (of 36 retracted articles) were post-retraction citations. The number of citations in KoMCI, except for citations of retraction notices, was 33 (of 14 retracted articles). Of those citations, the number of post-retraction citations in KoMCI was 14 (of 8 retracted articles). The presence of a retraction mark did not influence post-retraction citations (P> 0.05). Post-retraction citations were frequent in the range of 1 to 3 years.

RESULTS: There were 184 retracted surgical articles identified from 1991 through 2015. Average retraction time was 3.6 years. General (26%), Cardiac (22%), and Orthopedic (10%) surgery were most common. Reasons for retraction were duplication (35.3%), Institutional Review Board violations (18.5%), falsified data (14.7%), data errors (9.8%), author dispute (8.2%), plagiarism (7.6%), copyright violations (2.2%), financial disclosure violations (0.5%), and consent (0.5%). No reason for retraction was given in 8.7% of cases. Median IF was higher for administrative than content-related retraction reasons (3.0 vs. 2.0, P < 0.01). A paywall, requiring a subscription to read, restricted access to 23.4% of retraction notices.

We aimed to evaluate: (i) whether COVID-19-related preprints were favoured for publication, (ii) preprinting trends and public discussion of the preprints and (iii) relationship between the publication topic (COVID-19-related or not) and quality issues. Methods: Manuscripts deposited at bioRxiv and medRxiv between January 1 and October 21 were assessed for the probability of publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and those published were evaluated for submission-to-acceptance time. The extent of public discussion was assessed based on Altmetric and Disqus data. The Retraction Watch database and PubMed were used to explore the retraction of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 articles and preprints. Results: With adjustment for the preprinting server and number of deposited versions, COVID-19-related preprints were more likely to be published within 120 days since the deposition of the first version (OR=1.99, 95%CI 1.76-2.25) as well as over the entire observed period (OR=1.49, 95%CI 1.36-1.62). Submission-to-acceptance was by 41.69 days (95%CI 46.56-36.80) shorter for COVID-19 articles.

To test this, an investigation was carried out of post-retraction citations over a 19-year period in the Breuning case. METHODS: On 10 March 2008 a cited reference search was conducted (all languages, all document types) using the name 'Breuning SE*'. The time limit was 1989-2007 with an option to exclude self-citations. The search included the ISI Web of Science Database including the Science Citation Index Expanded, the Social Sciences Citations Index and the Arts & Humanities Citation Index. To ascertain the citation context, citations of Breuning were classified by two raters as affirmative, negative or neutral. FINDINGS: For the period 1989-2000 both negative and affirmative citations were found. For the period 2001-2006 only affirmative citations (even to retracted articles) were found, some in journals with higher impact factors than those citing the case as fraudulent. In spite of the small number of citations of Breuning's articles, it is alarming that the affirmative citing of fraudulent research has not completely ceased but continues 24 years post-retraction (retracted 1982, cited 2006). While the limitations of a single case study are conceded, the results challenge the belief of scientific literature purging itself of fraudulent material. CONCLUSIONS: Retraction databases and widespread availability of computer software to check lists of references free of charge in any database or the internet are called for. Moreover, if a paper is never formally retracted, software for searching author names in the internet for fully investigated and proven scientific misconduct might be developed. The ethical guidelines on duplicate publication for purposes of disseminating the information as widely as possible should be reviewed.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1185/03007991003603804 ", "Keywords": "*Bibliometrics\r\n*Biomedical Research\r\n*Databases, Bibliographic\r\nHistory, 20th Century\r\nHumans\r\n*Information Dissemination\r\nInformation Storage and Retrieval\r\n*Retraction of Publication as Topic\r\nScientific Misconduct/*history", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Korpela KM (2010) How long does it take for the scientific literature to purge itself of fraudulent material?: the Breuning case revisited.

The number of retracted articles has increased dramatically over the past 20 years and now comprises about .02% of the 2 million articles published each year. Retraction of publications available in large public databases can be analyzed as an objective measure for scientific misconduct and errors. In this project, we analyzed retractions of scientific publications using the Web of Science (WoS) and PubMed databases. We found that a power law is applicable to distributions of retracting authors and retracted publications with exponents of about -.6 and -3.0, respectively. Application of a power-law model for retracted publications implies that retraction is not a random event. Analysis of the retraction distributions suggests that a small fraction (1-2%) of retracting authors with >==5 retractions are responsible for around 10% of retraction. The probabilities for their repeating retraction are calculated using a statistical model: 3-5% likelihood of repeat retraction for authors with a single retraction at five years after the latest retraction and 26-37% for authors with five retractions at five years after the latest retraction. By focusing on those with repeated retractions, this analysis could contribute to identification of measures to reduce such repetition of retractions.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1080/08989621.2018.1449651 ", "Keywords": "Power law\r\nrepeating probability\r\nresearch misconduct\r\nretraction of publications", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Kuroki Toshio, and Ukawa Akira (2018) Repeating probability of authors with retracted scientific publications.

We have previously reported that incorrectly identified nucleotide sequence reagents are characteristic of highly similar human gene knockdown studies, some of which have been retracted from the literature on account of possible research fraud. Because of the throughput limitations of manual verification of nucleotide sequences, we developed a semi-automated fact checking tool, Seek & Blastn, to verify the targeting or non-targeting status of published nucleotide sequence reagents. From previously described and unknown corpora of 48 and 155 publications, respectively, Seek & Blastn correctly extracted 304/342 (88.9%) and 1066/1522 (70.0%) nucleotide sequences and a predicted targeting/non-targeting status. Seek & Blastn correctly predicted the targeting/non-targeting status of 293/304 (96.4%) and 988/1066 (92.7%) of the correctly extracted nucleotide sequences. A total of 38/39 (97.4%) or 31/79 (39.2%) Seek & Blastn predictions of incorrect nucleotide sequence reagent use were correct in the two literature corpora. Combined Seek & Blastn and manual analyses identified a list of 91 misidentified nucleotide sequence reagents, which could be built upon through future studies.

Therefore, we aimed to analyze the same clinical issues through an improved research method and to find out the differences from the retracted papers. We systematically reviewed pre-existing literature, and compared the results with those of the retracted papers to gain a novel insight. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted common risk factors identified in two retracted papers, and conducted relevant publication search until June 26, 2020 in PubMed. Then, we analyzed the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality and compared them to those of the retracted papers. RESULTS: Our systematic review demonstrated that most demographic and clinical risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were similar to those of the retracted papers. However, while the retracted paper indicated that both (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy and combination therapy with macrolide were associated with higher risk of mortality, our study showed that only combination therapy of hydroxychloroquine and macrolide was associated with higher risk of mortality (odds ratio 2.33; 95% confidence interval 1.63-3.34). In addition, our study demonstrated that use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) was associated with reduced risk of mortality (0.77; 0.65-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: When analyzing the same clinical issues with the two retracted papers through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and relevant cohort studies, we found out that (hydroxy)chloroquine monotherapy was not associated with higher risk of mortality, and that the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs was associated with reduced risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202012_24216 ", "Keywords": "African Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data\r\nAge Factors\r\nAngiotensin Receptor Antagonists/*therapeutic use\r\nAngiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use\r\nAsian Continental Ancestry Group/statistics & numerical data\r\nCOVID-19/drug therapy/epidemiology/immunology/*mortality\r\nCoronary Artery Disease/epidemiology\r\nDatabases, Factual\r\nDiabetes Mellitus/epidemiology\r\nDrug Therapy, Combination\r\nEnzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use\r\nHeart Failure/epidemiology\r\nHumans\r\nHydroxychloroquine/*therapeutic use\r\nHypertension/epidemiology\r\nImmunocompromised Host/immunology\r\nInformation Dissemination\r\nMacrolides/therapeutic use\r\nObesity/epidemiology\r\nOrgan Dysfunction Scores\r\nProtective Factors\r\nPulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/epidemiology\r\nRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic\r\n*Retraction of Publication as Topic\r\nRisk Factors\r\nSARS-CoV-2\r\nSeverity of Illness Index\r\nSex Factors\r\nSmoking/epidemiology", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Lee KH, Kim JS, Hong SH, Seong D, Choi YR, Ahn YT, Kim KS, Kim SE, Lee S, Sim W, Kim D, Jun B, Yang JW, Yon DK, Lee SW, Kim MS, Dragioti E, Li H, Jacob L, Koyanagi A, Abou Ghayda R, Shin JI, and Smith L (2020) Risk factors of COVID-19 mortality: a systematic review of current literature and lessons from recent retracted articles..

Both topics have so far not been investigated systematically. It is assumed that guideline authors underestimate the potential influences on the validity of their recommendations. On the basis of questions and the example of depression guidelines the potential influence of publication bias will be outlined and discussed. Formal consensus processes which are used to phrase and grade recommendations might protect guideline recommendations against the influence of publication bias and might thereby imply one major difference to systematic reviews. Based on the examples of Werner Bezwoda and Scott S. Reuben, who fabricated studies in breast cancer and analgesia, it can be estimated that scientific fraud has no or only minimal effect on the recommendations given in clinical guidelines. Either the fraudulent work is in line with other (true) studies, which consequently leads only to an overestimation of the quantity of evidence in the guideline. Or the faked study is the only piece of evidence available, which guideline authors would then regard as an insufficient basis for a clinical recommendation. Although publication bias and scientific fraud had no influence on the example guidelines, guideline authors should be aware of this possibility and control this problem by systematically reviewing the evidence, critically appraising primary studies, and formulating prudent recommendations.", "Comments": "Export Date: 28 January 2021", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1016/j.zefq.2010.03.035", "Keywords": "clinical guidelines\r\npublication bias\r\nreporting bias\r\nscientific fraud", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Lelgemann Monika, and Sauerland Stefan (2010) [German] Gef\u00e4lschte Studien und nicht publizierte Daten: Auswirkung auf die Erarbeitung von Leitlinien und evidenzbasierten Empfehlungen [Fraudulent studies, unpublished data and their effect on the development of guidelines and evidence-based recommendations].

Recently, the retraction of scientific publications has been on the rise. In this survey, we aimed to describe the characteristics and distribution of retracted articles and the reasons for retractions. Methods: We searched retracted articles on the PubMed database and Retraction Watch website from 1980 to February 2016. The primary outcomes were the characteristics and distribution of retracted articles and the reasons for retractions. The secondary outcomes included how article retractions were handled by journals and how to improve the journal practices toward article retractions. Results: We included 1,339 retracted articles. Most retracted articles had six authors or fewer. Article retraction was most common in the USA (26%), Japan (11%) and Germany (10%). The main reasons for article retraction were misconduct (51%, n = 685) and error (14%, n = 193). There were 66% (n = 889) of retracted articles having male senior or corresponding authors. Of the articles retracted after August 2010, 63% (n = 567) retractions were reported on Retraction Watch. Large discrepancies were observed in the ways that different journals handled article retractions. For instance, articles were completely withdrawn from some journals, while in others, articles were still available with no indication of retraction. Likewise, some retraction notices included a detailed account of the events that led to article retraction, while others only consisted of a statement indicating the article retraction.

The main purpose of this study is to identify two concerns including what is self-plagiarism in academic journals, conceivable point of contention, based on journal editors' viewpoint. Between 1990 and 2015, content of 57 editorials indexed in Scopus and WoS and 75 cases of self-plagiarism raised by international editors in COPE were analyzed to explore how journal editors identify these problems. The results show that self-plagiarism can be categorized to four facets, including its identification, types, norm, and remedy. And the editors are concerned about the issues about the detection software, salami-slicing and overlapping publication, the harm of copyright, and the retractions of published articles.

In the present study, we report the characteristics of retracted papers from clinical neurosurgery and allied clinical and basic science specialties. Methods: Retracted papers were identified using two separate search strategies on PubMed. Attributes of the retracted papers were collected from PubMed and the Retraction Watch database. The reasons for retraction were analyzed. The factors that correlated with time to retraction were identified. Detailed citation analysis for the retracted papers was performed. The retraction rates for neurosurgery journals were computed. Results: A total of 191 retractions were identified; 55% pertained to clinical neurosurgery. The most common reasons for retraction were plagiarism, duplication, and compromised peer review. The countries associated with the highest number of retractions were China, USA, and Japan. The full text of the retraction notice was not available for 11% of the papers. A median of 50% of all citations received by the papers occurred after retraction. The factors that correlated with a longer time to retraction included basic science category, the number of collaborating departments, and the H-index of the journal. The overall rate of retractions in neurosurgery journals was 0.037%. Conclusions: The retraction notice needs to be freely available on all search engines. Plagiarism checks and reference checks prior to publication of papers (to ensure no retracted papers have been cited) must be mandatory. Mandatory data deposition would help overcome issues with data and results.", "Comments": "Export Date: 28 January 2021", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-020-04615-z", "Keywords": "Citations\r\nDuplication\r\nGoogle Scholar\r\nNeurosurgery\r\nPlagiarism\r\nPubMed\r\nRetraction Watch\r\nRetractions", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Madhugiri Venkatesh S, Nagella Amrutha Bindu, and Uppar Alok Mohan (2021) An analysis of retractions in neurosurgery and allied clinical and basic science specialties.

Retraction of published papers is dependent on the visibility of journals and on post-publication scrutiny of published articles by peers. The possibility thus exists that not all compromised (\u201cretractable\u201d) papers are detected and retracted from the less-visible journals. The proportion of \u201cretractable\u201d papers and its converse, the proportion of published articles in each journal that are likely to be \u201ctrue\u201d (PTP), have not been estimated hitherto. Methods Three journal sets were created - pure neurosurgery journals (NS-P), the neurosurgery component of multi-disciplinary journals (NS-MD) and high-impact clinical journals (HICJ). We described a new metric \u2013 the retraction gap (RGap) \u2013 defined as the proportion of retractable papers in journals that have not been retracted. We computed the expected number of retractable papers, RGap and PTP for each journal, and compared these metrics across groups. Results Fifty-three NS-P journals, 10 NS-MD journals and 63 HICJs were included in the analysis. The estimated number of retractable papers was 31 times the actual number of retractions in NS-P journals, 6 times higher in the NS-MD journals and 26 times higher for the HICJs. The RGap was 96.7% for the NS-P group, 83.5% for the NS-MD group and 96.2% for the HICJs. The PTP was 99.3% in the NS-P group, 99.2% in the NS-MD group and 98.6% in the HICJs.

Materials and methods: On 16 January 2013, we extracted all tagged duplicate publications (DPs), analysed published notices, and then contacted MEDLINE and editors regarding cases unaddressed by notices. For non-respondents, we compared full text of the articles. We followed up the study for the next 5 years to see if any changes occurred. Results: We found 1011 indexed DPs, which represented 555 possible DP cases (in MEDLINE, both the original and the duplicate are assigned a DP tag). Six cases were excluded as we could not obtain their full text. Additional 190 (35%) cases were incorrectly tagged as DPs. Of 359 actual cases of DPs, 200 (54%) were due to publishers\u2019 actions (e.g. identical publications in the same journal), and 159 (46%) due to authors\u2019 actions (e.g. article submission to more than one journal). Of the 359 cases, 185 (52%) were addressed by notices, but only 25 (7%) retracted. Following our notifications, MEDLINE corrected 138 (73%) incorrectly tagged cases, and editors retracted 8 articles. Conclusions: Despite clear policies on how to handle DPs, just half (54%) of the DPs in MEDLINE were addressed by journals and only 9% retracted. Publishers, editors, and indexers need to develop and implement standards for better correction of duplicate published records. \u00a9 2019, Biochemia Medica, Editorial Office.

The orange nodes represent policy documents that explicitly cite the retracted paper in question, while the yellow nodes represent policy documents that cite previously contaminated policy documents. Note that only one policy report from the first wave flagged the publication as retracted (square node), while others cited the publication as valid scientific evidence. The study in question was published in Science in1996 by a group from Tulane University and presented evidence of certain pesticides having estrogenic activity (Arnold et al., 1996). However, the study could not be reproduced, which led its retraction in 1997, resignation of the first author and millions of dollars in lost financial costs due to its quick adoption by legislators (Turrens and Springer, 2019). This paper can be considered a textbook example of how a retracted paper can cause severe efffects due to its use by policy-makers, including after the official retraction. The graph was created using Altmetric API to extract data on policy mentions of the original Arnold et al. publication and later by using Dimensions API to search additional policy reports where initial policy reports were mentioned. Retraction Watch data were used to extract information on the retraction date and reason for retraction. The network can be expanded further, however, even the extent of contamination of the second wave reports is questionable as they may not directly build on previous policy reports. This assumption can be further tested by using text mining techniques or manual analysis. In this example, text mining was only used to identify first wave policy reports that contained the word retract* when referring to the original publication. References:Steven F. Arnold, Diane M.

All rights reserved.Background: Retraction is a mechanism for correcting the literature and a warning for readers in relation to publications that contain serious flaws or erroneous data. As a result of growth and development of Iranian publications in the last two decades, that brings unethical behavior of researchers led to retraction of their publications. We aimed to investigate Iranian retracted publications indexed in PubMed database. Methods: All Iranian retracted publications published in PubMed up to Dec 2017 have been retrieved. Bibliographic information of retracted publications, retraction notice, time lag between article publication date and the date of retraction notice, reasons of retraction, Issuer of retraction and acknowledge information of retracted publication were recorded. Additionally, citation data of retracted publications before 2013 were analyzed. Results: Overall, 164 Iranian retracted publications were identified. Meantime lag was 20.8 months. \"Islamic Azad University\" and \"Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS)\" were two affiliations that have received highest number of retracted publications. The most issuer of retraction publications was editor-in-chief and the most mentioned reasons for retractions were authorship issues, plagiarism, and redundant publication. Thirty-three (20.12%) publications have received funds from various agencies.

In this study, we investigated the linguistic patterns of fraudulent (N = 24; 170,008 words) and genuine publications (N = 25; 189,705 words) first-authored by social psychologist Diederik Stapel. The analysis revealed that Stapel's fraudulent papers contained linguistic changes in science-related discourse dimensions, including more terms pertaining to methods, investigation, and certainty than his genuine papers. His writing style also matched patterns in other deceptive language, including fewer adjectives in fraudulent publications relative to genuine publications. Using differences in language dimensions we were able to classify Stapel's publications with above chance accuracy. Beyond these discourse dimensions, Stapel included fewer co-authors when reporting fake data than genuine data, although other evidentiary claims (e.g., number of references and experiments) did not differ across the two article types.

We also observed a positive association between obfuscation and the number of references per paper, suggesting that fraudulent authors obfuscate their reports to mask their deception by making them more costly to analyze and evaluate. This is the first large-scale analysis of fraudulent papers across authors and disciplines to reveal how changes in writing style are related to fraudulent data reporting.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1177/0261927X15614605", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Markowitz David M, and Hancock Jeffrey T (2016) Linguistic obfuscation in fraudulent science.

The authors of the current article examined the impact of Reuben reports on conclusions of systematic reviews. METHODS: The authors searched in ISI Web of Knowledge systematic reviews citing Reuben reports. Systematic reviews were grouped into one of three categories: I, only cited but did not include Reuben reports; II, retrieved and considered, but eventually excluded Reuben reports; III, included Reuben reports. For quantitative systematic reviews (i.e., meta-analyses), a relevant difference was defined as a significant result becoming nonsignificant (or vice versa) by excluding Reuben reports. For qualitative systematic reviews, each author decided independently whether noninclusion of Reuben reports would have changed conclusions. RESULTS: Twenty-five systematic reviews (5 category I, 6 category II, 14 category III) cited 27 Reuben reports (published 1994-2007). Most tested analgesics in surgical patients. One of 6 quantitative category III reviews would have reached different conclusions without Reuben reports. In all 6 (30 subgroup analyses involving Reuben reports), exclusion of Reuben reports never made any difference when the number of patients from Reuben reports was less than 30% of all patients included in the analysis. Of 8 qualitative category III reviews, all authors agreed that one would certainly have reached different conclusions without Reuben reports. For another 4, the authors' judgment was not unanimous. CONCLUSIONS: Carefully performed systematic reviews proved robust against the impact of Reuben reports. Quantitative systematic reviews were vulnerable if the fraudulent data were more than 30% of the total. Qualitative systematic reviews seemed at greater risk than quantitative. \u00a9 2009, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.

Hunton (Dr. Hunton) and various other co-authors. Retractions in academic literatures are not entirely rare and they are best understood in terms of their \u2018chain effect\u2019 potential impact. There is a first-order effect, namely the findings in the retracted papers are no longer reliable. A second-order effect occurs through other papers that cited and relied upon certain findings in the retracted papers. This paper sets forth the recently retracted papers. It will also be useful in identifying second-order papers to assist editors, other reviewers, and researchers who otherwise may be unaware of retraction details as they are known at this time. This article sets forth Dr. Hunton's body of work with retractions noted. The article has several goals aimed at effective regulation of the accounting literature. First, it is a resource for researchers to determine whether a paper that they intend to cite has been retracted. Second, it encourages researchers to review and where feasible, replicate other papers authored by Dr. Hunton that have not been retracted to date in order to establish the legitimacy of those findings. Third, it encourages researchers to replicate or otherwise retest research questions in retracted papers so that reliable findings are made available to these questions. Fourth, at the second-order level, it encourages authors that have cited Dr. Hunton's papers to review their papers and where they deem it consistent with scholarly effort, restate their work. Similarly, editors of journals involved in the first- and second-order effects are encouraged to publish the additional analyses to reinforce the credibility of the literature. Fifth, an addition to the literature review process is suggested to assure that no papers in the chain of noted or cited work have been retracted. Finally and importantly, it reminds scholars of the importance of being diligent in their processes for producing, summarizing and retaining data and cross-reviewing data provided by and work completed by co-authors. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd", "Comments": "Cited By :1 | Export Date: 21 April 2020", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1016/j.racreg.2017.04.002", "Keywords": "Accounting literature\r\nAmerican Accounting Association\r\nJames Hunton\r\nRetraction", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Meckfessel Michele, and Moehrle Stephen (2017) Self-regulation of the academic accounting literature: The case of James Hunton.

METHODS: Three databases (PUBMED, Embase, Retraction Watch) were queried for all retracted studies on urological topics in both urological and non-urological journals from April 1999 to March 2018. Two reviewers screened the records and determined the final list of articles to be included in the analysis. RESULTS: A total of 138 articles met the inclusion criteria. Over 80% of retractions occurred after 2009. Retractions originated from 76 different journals (13 urological journals) and 28 countries. The most common reasons for retraction were plagiarism (28%), fake peer review (20%), error (20%), and falsification of data (13%). Misconduct accounted for two-thirds of the retractions (n = 93). A large watermark, indicating retraction of the article, was present in 75% of the manuscripts. Articles were cited a total of 4454 times, 38% of citations happened after retraction. The majority of retracted articles related to urological oncology (70%). The highest number of retractions for an individual author was five. Rates of retraction among popular urological journals since 2010 have increased but remain a small proportion of all publications: BJUI, 0.189%; World Journal of Urology, 0.132%; European Urology, 0.058%; Urology, 0.047%; and Journal of Urology, 0.024%.

In the last two decades we begin to understand the magnitude of both phenomena; this is the basis of our objective of knowing if the media contribute to taking this problem beyond the investigative sphere, thus fulfilling the functions of control and reporting of journalism. To find out, we proposed a descriptive study of a corpus of information published in 21 digital newspapers, obtained by tracking their websites and using horizontal search engines. The results reveal that journalists and the media have been subjecting this investigation system problem to public scrutiny, but without the desired continuity or depth. One of the conclusions is that the informative coverage of scientific fraud and scientific misconduct does not derive from investigative journalism or journalistic follow-up by the investigative system, but from sporadic, well-known and decontextualized cases.", "Comments": "Export Date: 28 January 2021", "ParentAuthors": "", "Keywords": "Journalism training\r\nMisconduct\r\nScientific ethics\r\nScientific fraud\r\nScientific journalism", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Meneses-Fern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00eda Dolores, and Santana-Hern\u00e1ndez Juana Dolores (2020) [Spanish] Construcci\u00f3n period\u00edstica de la mala praxis cient\u00edfica: An\u00e1lisis en diarios digitales [Journalistic construction of scientific malpractice: Analysis in digital news media].

Criteria for authorship, as delineated in the guidelines by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), have undergone evolution over the decades, and now require fulfillment of four criteria, including the need to be able to take responsibility for all aspects of the manuscript in question. Although such updated authorship criteria were published nearly five years ago, still, many major medical and specialist journals have yet to revise their author instructions to conform to this. Inappropriate authorship practices may include gift, guest or ghost authorship. Existing literature suggests that such practices are still widely prevalent, especially in non-English speaking countries. Another emerging problem is that of peer review fraud, mostly by authors, but also rarely by handling editors. There is literature to suggest that a proportion of such fake peer review may be driven by the support of some unscrupulous external editing agencies. Such inappropriate practices with authorship malpractices or disagreement, or peer review fraud, have resulted in more than 600 retractions each, as identified on the retractions database of Retractionwatch.com. There is a need to generate greater awareness, especially in authors from non-English speaking regions of the world, about inappropriate authorship and unethical practices in peer review.

Canadian oncologists were surveyed regarding characteristics that may influence error propagation. Errors published during 2004-2007 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI) were classified as trivial or serious (that is, whether change in outcome was involved). The frequency of citation and error propagation was determined for serious errors.\r\rResults\r\rOf the 10 journals reviewed, 9 present links from the original article to the erratum; in 4 of those 9 journals, at least 1 link was missing. Survey results indicate that 33% of oncologists do not read errata, and 45% have read only the abstract when referencing an article. Although 59% of oncologists have noticed errors in cancer publications, only 13% reported the error. Together, JCO and JNCI published 190 errata, for an error rate of 4% \u00b1 1% (standard deviation) annually; 26 of 190 errors were serious (14%). The median time from publication of the article to the corresponding erratum was 3.5 months for trivial errors as compared with 8.3 months for serious errors (p = 0.03). Error propagation in citations before and after publication of the erratum was 15% and 2% respectively (p < 0.01).\r\rConclusions\r\rError rates in high-impact oncology journals average 4%, which is likely an underestimate, because errors noticed by readers are not consistently reported.

METHODS: We used an interrupted time-series with matched controls. PubMed, CINHAL, Google and the Retraction Watch Database were searched. We identified retracted publications reporting the results of randomized controlled trials involving human participants with two years of available data before and after retraction. We obtained monthly citation counts across all articles for the 24 months before and after retraction, from Web of Science. We used a Poisson segmented regression to detect changes in the level and trend of citation following retraction. We also undertook a matched control analysis of unretracted randomized controlled trials and a sensitivity analysis to account for cases of large-scale, well-advertised fraud. RESULTS: We identified 387 retracted randomized controlled trial reports, of which 218 (56.3%) were included in the interrupted time-series analysis. A reduction of 22.9% (95% CI 4.0% to 38.2%, p = 0.02) was observed in the number of citations in the month after retraction, and a further reduction of 1.9% (95% CI 0.4% to 3.5%, p = 0.02) per month in the following 24 months, relative to the expected trend. There was no evidence of a statistically significant reduction among the matched controls. Authors with a large number of retractions saw a 48.2% reduction at the time of retraction (95% CI 17.7% to 67.3%, p = 0.01). Other cases had a more gradual reduction with no change at the time of retraction and a 1.8% reduction per month in the following 24 months (95% CI 0.2% to 3.4%, p = 0.03).

Design/setting Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 134 retractions from January 2000 to December 2015. Results 134 retraction notices were published during this timeframe. Although they account for 0.07% of all articles published (190\u2005514 excluding supplements, corrections, retractions and commissioned content), the rate of retraction is rising. COPE guidelines on retraction were adhered to in that an explicit reason for each retraction was given. However, some notices did not document who retracted the article (eight articles, 6%) and others were unclear whether the underlying cause was honest error or misconduct (15 articles, 11%). The largest proportion of notices was issued by the authors (47 articles, 35%). The majority of retractions were due to some form of misconduct (102 articles, 76%), that is, compromised peer review (44 articles, 33%), plagiarism (22 articles, 16%) and data falsification/fabrication (10 articles, 7%). Honest error accounted for 17 retractions (13%) of which 10 articles (7%) were published in error. The median number of days from publication to retraction was 337.5\u2005days. Conclusions The most common reason to retract was compromised peer review. However, the majority of these cases date to March 2015 and appear to be the result of a systematic attempt to manipulate peer review across several publishers. Retractions due to plagiarism account for the second largest category and may be reduced by screening manuscripts before publication although this is not guaranteed. Retractions due to problems with the data may be reduced by appropriate data sharing and deposition before publication.

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the reasons for and the rate of article retraction in the field of anesthesia within the last 30 years. METHODS: Based on a reproducible search strategy, two independent reviewers searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Retraction Watch website to identify retracted anesthesiology articles. Extracted data included: author names, year of publication, year of the retracted article, journal name, journal five-year impact factor, research type (clinical, basic science, or review), reason for article retraction, number of citations, and presence of a watermark indicating article retraction. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty articles were included for data extraction. Reasons for article retraction could be grouped into six broad categories. The most common reason for retraction was fraud (data fabrication or manipulation), which accounted for nearly half (49.4%) of all retractions, followed by lack of appropriate ethical approval (28%). Other reasons for retraction included publication issues (e.g., duplicate publications), plagiarism, and studies with methodologic or other non-fraud data issues. Four authors were associated with most of the retracted articles (59%). The majority (69%) of publications utilized a watermark on the original article to indicate that the article was retracted. Journal Citation Reports journal impact factors ranged from 0.9 to 48.1 (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 3.6 [2.5-4.0]), and the most cited article was referenced 197 times (median [IQR], 13 [5-26]). Most retracted articles (66%) were cited at least once by other journal articles after having been withdrawn.

DATA SOURCE AND STUDY SELECTION: All retractions of English language publications indexed in MEDLINE between 1982 and 2002 were extracted. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers categorised the reasons for retraction of each article as misconduct (falsification, fabrication, or plagiarism) or unintentional error (mistakes in sampling, procedures, or data analysis; failure to reproduce findings; accidental omission of information about methods or data analysis). DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 395 articles retracted between 1982 and 2002, 107 (27.1%) were retracted because of scientific misconduct, 244 (61.8%) because of unintentional errors, and 44 (11.1%) could not be categorised. Compared with articles retracted because of misconduct, articles with unintentional mistakes were more likely to have multiple authors, no reported funding source, and to be published in frequently cited journals. They were more likely to be retracted by the author(s) of the article, and the retraction was more likely to occur more promptly (mean, 2.0 years; 95% CI, 1.8-2.2) than articles withdrawn because of misconduct (mean, 3.3 years; 95% CI, 2.7-3.9) (P < 0.05 for all comparisons).

An increase in the occurrence of retractions in recent years has been reported. Nevertheless, there is scarce information on this topic concerning publications in dentistry and related specialties. Thus, this study aimed to investigate retracted papers published in dental journals. METHODS: Data collection included an exploratory search in PubMed and a specific search in SCImago Journal Rank indexed journals, complemented by the cases reported on the Retraction Watch website and in PubMed. All 167 dental journals included in SCImago were searched for identification of retracted articles up to March 2016. The selected retracted articles and their corresponding retraction notices were recorded and assessed for classification according to the reason for retraction and other additional information. RESULTS: Forty of the 167 journals scrutinised at SCImago (23.9%) had at least one retracted article, and four additional journals were identified from the Retraction Watch website. A total of 72 retracted found were retracted for the reasons: redundant publication (20.8%), plagiarism (18.1%), misconduct (13.8%), overlap (13.6%) and honest error (9.7%). Higher number of retractions were reported in those journals with cites/doc <2.0-n = 49 (74.2%). The types of studies were mainly laboratory studies (34.7%), case reports (22.2%) and review articles (13.9%).

This article aims to demonstrate that retractions have gradually increased, especially in the medical field. Methodologically, it is a literature review article whose statistical data were obtained from studies on retraction articles published in English between 2012 to 2017 in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Some of the most frequent causes of retraction found were plagiarism, misconduct, errors, fabrication and duplication. The highest incidence rate was reported in the United States, India, China, Japan and Germany. The highest retraction rate was for low-impact journals.

The relationship, time delay, and evolution of these publications were then compared, as was their incidence in journals and disciplines. The results show that the relationship between them is scant, the increase in these notices is in proportion to the scientific literature, and the time delay between publication and editorial notice is frequently over 3 years. According to incidence, editorial notices are more frequent in journals specializing in biochemistry, medicine, and multidisciplinarity, and cancer journals release more errata. Research areas with more editorial notices are the life and health sciences. The research fields with the highest percentages of errata and retractions are Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology, and Immunology and Microbiology.

Background: Journal article retractions are a growing problem in all fields of medicine. Prior works have investigated retractions in plastic surgery, neurosurgery, cardiology, and a few other fields. However, no such work has been done in neurology. Design/Methods: We searched the Retraction Watch database for articles in the field of neurology that had been retracted till July 2020. We extracted the data, and investigated trends in year of retraction, country of origin, article type and reasons for retraction, amongst others. Results: We obtained 566 eligible articles. The number of retractions has been rising rapidly in recent years, with merely 16.9% of all retractions till 2010 and 56% within 2016\u20132020. Retractions were highest from United States (28.8%), followed by China (22.4%) and Japan (16.3%). Original research articles were the most common type (74%), followed by review articles (9%). With 18 retractions, the journal Neurology had the highest number. Only 23% of articles were retracted due to \u2018plagiarism\u2019 (23%), with majority of others retracted due to various types of research misconduct. However, the median (IQR) time to retraction after publication was 1.45 (3.08) years, resulting in some articles continuing to generate citations for a significant time before a notice of retraction gets attached. Conclusions: In neurology, retractions continue to form a growing but small part of the literature. However, the recent rate of their increase has been rapid, similar to other specialties. There is large variation in time to retraction after publication. Plagiarism remains the most common \u2018single identifiable cause\u2019 of retraction, suggesting better integration of manuscript submission platforms with plagiarism-detection and web-indexing softwares is needed. Greater scrutiny for misconduct by journal editors and reviewers, and expanded training in research ethics may help prevent an upcoming crisis of research fraud.Disclosure: Mr. Ozair has nothing to disclose.

Retraction is the mechanism used by publishers to indicate that a study is problematic.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo assess how Campbell and Cochrane Reviews have dealt with retracted studies, and to calculate the prevalence of retracted studies in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe searched the Cochrane Library through the Wiley interface, looking for the word \"retraction\" in the full text of the review. We searched full text of Campbell reviews by using the site restricted search in Google. To calculate the prevalence of retractions, we used the function \u201cincluded in review\u201d and \u201cin Medline\u201d of the Cochrane Register of Studies on-line, retrieve the unique identifiers for each study and crossed them with \"Retracted Publication\" heading on Publication Type.\n\nResults:\n\nFor Cochrane Reviews, 37 reviews have identified retracted studies, and including a total of 63 retracted studies. Thirty-four reviews excluded the retracted studies, noting this in the table of excluded studies. Of the 37 reviews, 70% had only one study retracted. The range of retractions went from one to nine. Two reviews attempted sensitivity analysis to assess the impact the retracted studies would have had, if included. Of the three reviews that included retracted studies, one noted the retraction and announced that the study would be withdrawn in a future update. The other two considered that the reasons for retraction of the studies did not invalidate the data, and decided to include the study.\n\nFor Campbell reviews, no reviews had mentioned retracted studies.\n\nFor the prevalence of retracted studies, a preliminary search limited to one Cochrane Group shows it affects a minority of all included studies: only 0.0025% (4/1625) are retracted studies.\n\nConclusions:\n\nRetracted studies are an infrequent problem, but they appear often enough to potentially influence the results of some Cochrane Reviews. A simple exclusion of retracted studies might lead to publication bias. Careful consideration of the exclusion of the studies is needed, and to evaluate the impact that any decision could have in the results of the review in a sensitivity analysis.\n\nPatient or healthcare consumer involvement:\n\nNo patients were involved in developing this project.", "Comments": "FIX AUTHORS; abstract only; write authors; no full publication found as of 2021-05-30", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD201801", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Pardo Pardo J, Harbin S, and Welch V (2018) Are retracted studies affecting our reviews?.

My goal is to overcome a human-centered, Korea-oriented narrative, by illustrating how materials can have an integral role in the construction and judgment of fraud. To this end, I pay attention to Woo Suk Hwang\u2019s lab at Seoul National University as a whole, including human and nonhuman agents, that functioned as what I call sociomaterial technology, and Gerald P.

The author describes an instructive incident of tainted data and a subsequent allegation of misconduct that involved a federally-sponsored study where some data had been fabricated. The journals that had published or were considering articles from that study were not told about the problem for almost four years after the initial allegations of misconduct. The author then provides information to throw light on such questions as: Who has the responsibility to ensure that a manuscript that may contain falsified or fabricated data is not published? Who has the responsibility to correct the literature when falsified or fabricated data have been published, and at what point should that correction be made? For example, should it be when the problem of data is suspected or when it is proven? And if proven, proven by whom? How is the larger scientific community to be notified about the problem? Where and when should the correction or retraction appear, and what should it tell readers about the basis for the retraction or correction? She also presents data from 25 cases to show the various lengths of time involved in correcting the literature after allegations of research misconduct had been made. The author concludes that the record shows how disconnected journal editors have been from the scientific misconduct process and that expectations differ regarding the obligations of authors, research institutions, and federal agencies about informing a journal when an allegation of scientific misconduct is made about a publication in its pages. The 25 cases show that substantial delays in notifying the journal and the public about allegations and findings of scientific misconduct are endemic, and that all parties have far to go in appreciating their roles in maintaining the integrity of the biomedical literature.", "Comments": "Table  1 - delay in months corrrection/retraction\r\rKIE: Parrish, Debra M | KIE: 51 refs. | KIE: KIE Bib: fraud and misconduct", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1097/00001888-199903000-00009", "Keywords": "Biomedical Research\r\nGovernment Regulation\r\nHumans\r\nManuscripts, Medical as Topic\r\nPeriodicals as Topic/*legislation & jurisprudence\r\nPublishing/*legislation & jurisprudence\r\nResearch Support as Topic/legislation & jurisprudence\r\n*Retraction of Publication as Topic\r\nScientific Misconduct/*legislation & jurisprudence\r\nSocial Responsibility\r\nUnited States\r\nBiomedical and Behavioral Research", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Parrish Debra M (1999) Scientific misconduct and correcting the scientific literature.

Eighty-four of these libraries manually reviewed the available copies they held of ten retracted articles.

Seventy-nine percent of the libraries had tagged none of the retracted studies and only 16% had policies for managing articles that report invalid science. Academic librarians reflected a common attitude against perceived library censorship and emphasized the user's role in assuring validity. The nation's medical libraries, at least in part by intent, do not commonly identify or have policies to handle the invalid articles they hold.

This article provides simple methods that might help to appraise the quality of the reporting of randomized, controlled trials (RCT). METHODS: This evaluation roadmap proposed herein relies on four steps: evaluation of the distribution of the reported variables; evaluation of the distribution of the reported p values; data simulation using parametric bootstrap and explicit computation of the p values. Such an approach was illustrated using published data from a retracted RCT comparing a hydroxyethyl starch versus albumin-based priming for cardiopulmonary bypass. RESULTS: Despite obvious nonnormal distributions, several variables are presented as if they were normally distributed. The set of 16 p values testing for differences in baseline characteristics across randomized groups did not follow a Uniform distribution on [0,1] (p = 0.045). The p values obtained by explicit computations were different from the results reported by the authors for the two following variables: urine output at 5 hours (calculated p value < 10-6, reported p >/= 0.05); packed red blood cells (PRBC) during surgery (calculated p value = 0.08; reported p < 0.05). Finally, parametric bootstrap found p value > 0.05 in only 5 of the 10,000 simulated datasets concerning urine output 5 hours after surgery. Concerning PRBC transfused during surgery, parametric bootstrap showed that only the corresponding p value had less than a 50% chance to be inferior to 0.05 (3,920/10,000, p value < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Such simple evaluation methods might offer some warning signals. However, it should be emphasized that such methods do not allow concluding to the presence of error or fraud but should rather be used to justify asking for an access to the raw data.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1186/2110-5820-3-29 ", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Pirracchio Romain, Resche-Rigon Matthieu, Chevret Sylvie, and Journois Didier (2013) Do simple screening statistical tools help to detect reporting bias?.

For instance, retractions help scientific enterprise perform its self-correcting function and provide lessons for future researchers; furthermore, they represent the fulfillment of social responsibilities, and they enable scientific communities to offer better monitoring services to keep problematic studies in check. This study aims to provide a thorough overview of the practice of retraction in scientific publishing from the first incident to the present. Methods: We built a database using SQL Server 2016 and homemade artificial intelligence tools to extract and classify data sources including RetractionWatch, official publishers' archives, and online communities into ready-to-analyze groups and to scan them for new data. After data cleaning, a dataset of 18,603 retractions from 1,753 (when the first retracted paper was published) to February 2019, covering 127 research fields, was established. Results: Notable retraction events include the rise in retracted articles starting in 1999 and the unusual number of retractions in 2010. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Elsevier, and Springer account for nearly 60% of all retracted papers globally, with Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers contributing the most retractions, even though it is not the organization that publishes the most journals.

Within days of the review's publication, scientists identified major coding errors and other methodological problems that invalidated the principal conclusions of the study and led to a retraction. While the original study results and their negative conclusions were widely publicized in the media, the retraction seemed to go unnoticed. Objective: This paper aims to document an unprecedented case of misinformation from a Cochrane review and its impact on media, scientists, and patients. As well, it aims to identify the generic factors leading to the incident and suggest remedies. Methods: This was a qualitative study of the events leading to the retraction of the publication and of the reactions from media, scientists, and patients. This includes a review and content analysis of academic and mass media articles responding to the publication and retraction. Mass media articles were retrieved in May 2005 from LexisNexis Academic and Google and were classified and tallied. The extended case method is employed, and the analysis is also applied to comparable publishing events. Results: A search on LexisNexis Academic database with the query \"Elizabeth Murray AND health\" for the period of June 2004 to May 2005 revealed a total of 15 press reports, of which only 1 addressed the retraction. Google was searched for references to the review, and the first 200 retrieved hits were analyzed. Of these, 170 pages were not related to the review. Of the remaining 30 pages, 23 (77%) were reports about the original publication that did not mention the retraction, 1 (3%) was a bibliography not mentioning the retraction, and 6 (20%) addressed the retraction, of which only 1 was a non-Cochrane-related source. Conclusions: Analyzed retrievals showed that the mass media gave more coverage to the Cochrane review than to the retraction or to a related systematic review with a similar scope but a different conclusion. Questionable results were prematurely disseminated, oversimplified, and sensationalized, while the retraction was hardly noticed by the public. Open commentary by scientists and patients helped to rapidly identify the errors but did not prevent or correct the dissemination of misinformation.", "Comments": "Cited By :9 | Export Date: 19 July 2018 | Correspondence Address: Rada, R.; Department of Information Systems, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, 1000 Hilltop Circle, Baltimore, MD 21250, United States; email: rada@umbc.edu | References: Green, S., Mcdonald, S., Cochrane Collaboration: More than systematic reviews?

Next, the archives of LexisNexis's 'Major Newspapers' and EurekAlert's press releases were searched to find references to those retracted publications. Results: Newspaper articles addressed exactly three of the 50 retracted publications, and press releases, exactly four of the 50 retracted publications. All three retracted publications that received newspaper coverage also had a press release. In other words, newspapers only covered a retraction that had been introduced by a press release. Conclusion: One would expect that newspaper coverage would increase after a press release, but the suggested relationships among a medical journal article retraction, a press release and newspaper coverage should be further investigated.

The purpose of our study was to assess the prevalence, characteristics, and trends of retracted publications in the field of orthopaedics. METHODS: Five databases were utilized to identify retracted publications in orthopaedics. The cited articles were assessed for various characteristics, including reason for retraction, based on the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and trends over time. RESULTS: From 1984 to June 4, 2016, 59 of 229,502 orthopaedic publications were retracted (3 per 10,000 articles). There was a spike in the prevalence (22 of 59) of retracted articles in 2015. When compared with the total number of retracted publications identified through PubMed, the field of orthopaedics represented 1.4% of all retracted publications. The original version of 47 of these 59 retracted publications was still available on the respective journal's web site; 14 (30%) of these were not noted as having been retracted. The mean time from electronic publication to retraction was 19.4 +/- 23.3 months. The mean number of citations of a retracted publication after the date of retraction was 9.3 +/- 19.3. Reasons for retraction included plagiarism (32%), misconduct (27%), redundant publication (22%), miscalculation or experimental error (8%), and unethical research (0%); the reason for retraction was not stated for 10% of the publications. There was no correlation between a journal's impact factor and the mean number of months to retraction (p = 0.564). CONCLUSIONS: While uncommon, the retraction of publications within the field of orthopaedics may be increasing. The most often cited reasons for retraction were plagiarism, misconduct, and redundant publication. Retracted articles continue to be cited in the literature after retraction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Greater awareness of the COPE guidelines within the orthopaedic community and more efficient means to prevent the citation of retracted articles are needed.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.2106/JBJS.16.01116 ", "Keywords": "Databases, Bibliographic\r\nDuplicate Publication as Topic\r\nOrthopedics/statistics & numerical data/*trends\r\nPlagiarism\r\n*Retraction of Publication as Topic\r\nScientific Misconduct/statistics & numerical data/trends", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Rai Rahul, and Sabharwal Sanjeev (2017) Retracted publications in orthopaedics: prevalence, characteristics, and trends.

Material and methods This review has been recorded in the PROSPERO database (CRD42017075634). Two independent reviewers performed an electronic search (Pubmed, Retraction Watch) for retracted articles in dental literature up to December 31, 2018. Results 180 retracted papers were identified, the first published in 2001. Retractions increased by 47% in the last four-year period (2014-2018), when compared with 2009-2013 (94 and 64 retracted publications, respectively). Author misconduct was the most common reason for retraction (65.0%), followed by honest scientific errors (12.2%) and publisher-related issues (10.6%). The majority of retracted research was conducted in Asia (55.6%), with 49 papers written in India (27.2%). 552 researchers (89%) are listed as authors in only one retracted article, while 10 researchers (1.6%) are present in five or more retracted publications. Retracted articles were cited 530 times after retraction: the great majority of these citations (89.6%) did not consider the existence of the retraction notice and treated data from retracted articles as reliable. Conclusions Retractions in dental literature have constantly increased in recent years, with the majority of them due to misconduct and fraud. The publication of unreliable research has many negative consequences.

Teams can be more productive and achieve more attention to their work. It is, however, unclear, whether teams also lead to higher research integrity. On the one hand, there may be a volunteer's dilemma in larger groups such that the responsibility diffuses who is controlling whom. The 'volunteer hypothesis' predicts that the more co-authors, the more scientific misconduct. On the other hand, larger groups may also achieve a higher level of social control. The 'control hypothesis' predicts that the more co-authors, the less scientific misconduct. Retractions are used as an operationalization of scientific misconduct. The data collection comprises of retracted articles from the Web of Science data set. In addition, control groups of non-retracted articles are constructed, using methods known from causal inference and bibliometrics. The analyses demonstrate that larger author groups have a lower retraction probability compared to smaller author groups. This suggests that teams prevent misconduct, most likely by their higher ability to social control. The results indicate that the development towards more and larger research collaborations may have positive macro-level consequences for the system of science.", "Comments": "scientometrics conference paper - nothing here by this author; wrote author 2021-05-17 and 2021-06-23", "ParentAuthors": "", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Rathmann Justus MK, and Rauhut Heiko (2019) Teams prevent misconduct: A study of retracted articles from the Web of Science.

Retraction by parties other than authors is increasing, especially for research misconduct. Although retractions are on average occurring sooner after publication than in the past, citation analysis shows that they are not being recognised by subsequent users of the work.

Increasingly, these dynamics have been marked by changes in scientific communication. Researchers' attitudes toward open science, alternative models of publication and toward originality are among the elements shaping the current scientific landscape. This changing panorama reflects on the attitude of authors, editors and publishers toward the correction of the literature, a practice that is encountered to different extents in different fields. This practice may suggest, among several issues, commitment of the scientific community to boosting the reliability of the research record. Would the research output of countries have any association with this panorama? We analyzed 1623 retractions issued in 2013-2015 and discussed in Retraction Watch (RW), www.retractionwatch.com. These retractions account for a considerable fraction of the total of retraction notices in PubMed in the same period. They were categorized by reason, field and country (that of the corresponding author). These retractions were distributed among 71 countries, with 15 countries accounting for a major share (85%)-most of those with the largest number of publications in the Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR). However, there is no consistent pattern for the relationship between ranking in SJR and ranking in number of retractions across countries in our RW dataset, which is skewed mostly by the fact that the RW website tends to post newsworthy retractions, with a bias toward biomedical and clinical sciences. This caveat notwithstanding, the prevalence of the most productive countries in our dataset of retractions is worth noting.

The purpose of this study was to characterize trends related to retracted publications within radiology journals. MATERIALS AND METHODS. PubMed was queried to identify all articles with the publication type \"retracted publication\" or \"notification of retraction.\" Articles published within radiology journals were identified using Journal Citation Reports' journal categories. Available versions of original articles and publication notices were accessed from journal websites. Citations to retracted publications were identified using Web of Science. Overall trends were assessed. RESULTS. Forty-eight retracted original research articles were identified within radiology journals since 1983, which included 1.1% of all PubMed \"retracted publication\" entries. Distinct PubMed entries were available for the retracted publication and retraction notification in 39 of 48 articles. The original PDF was available for 37 articles, although the articles were not watermarked as retracted in 23 cases. In six cases with a watermarked PDF, further searches identified nonwatermarked versions. Original HTML versions were available for 13 articles but 11 were not watermarked. The mean (+/- SD) delay between publication and retraction was 2.7 +/- 2.8 years (range, 0-16 years). The mean number of citations to retracted articles was 10.9 +/- 17.1 (range, 0-94 citations). Reasons for retraction included problematic or incorrect methods or results (although it typically was unclear whether these represented honest errors or misconduct) in 33.3% of cases, complete or partial duplicate publication in 33.3% of cases, plagiarism in 14.6% of cases, a permission issue in 8.3% of cases, the publisher's error in 6.3% of cases, and no identified reason in 6.3% of cases. One or no retractions occurred annually from 1986 to 2001, although two or more retractions occurred annually in nine of the 12 years from 2002 through 2013. CONCLUSION. Retraction represents an uncommon, yet potentially increasing, issue within radiology journals that publishers have inconsistently and insufficiently addressed.

The experimental research consists of two groups: the research group and the control group. The research group is composed of scientific retractions published in the Web of Science database from 1945 to 2015. The target documents were those whose title included the following words: \u201cretracted\u201d or \u201cretraction\u201d or \u201cwithdrawal\u201d or \u201credress\u201d. On the other hand, randomly selected articles constituted the control group; they were selected from the same periodical, number, and volume of the research group articles. The data collected sought to address the study\u2019s goals, such as analyzing the amount of citations and self-citations, the profile of the retracted articles, density, and obsolescence of the publications. To analyze the data, the Kolmogorov Smirnov, Mann-Whitney, and Tukey-Kramer tests were used, along with descriptive statistics. 238 retracted articles and 236 non-retracted articles were analyzed. The analysis shows that the retracted articles have been quoted 2,348 times, with 1,291 citations before retraction and 1,057 after retraction. Furthermore, the retracted articles were quoted 9.87 times, on average. The non-retracted articles received 2,957 citations, with an average of 12.53. In the matter of self-citation, the retracted articles had 555 self-citations, of which 481 occurred before retraction, and 74 after, with an average of 2.33. In contrast, the non-retracted articles received 396 self-citations, with an average of 1.68. Mostly, the articles included an average of 35.5 references and the mean lifespan was five years. The main reasons for retraction are unethical research, in 81 cases, and plagiarism, with 66 cases. Usually, the editors publish the retractions within one or two years after article publication. The study verified that the retracted articles are less cited than non-retracted articles. Essentially, the results suggest that retracted articles receive more self-citations than non-retracted articles, while the number of self-citations is higher before than after the retraction. As such, it is necessary to emphasize that researchers and periodicals may put science\u2019s credibility at risk while preventive and corrective methods are not truly effective in combating scientific misconduct.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Rubbo Priscila (2018) [Portuguese] A Desonestidade Cient\u00edfica e seu Reflexo na Retrata\u00e7\u00e3o de Artigos Indexados na Base Web of Science, no Per\u00edodo de 1945 a 2015 [Scientific Dishonesty and its Impact on the Retraction of Articles Indexed in the Web of Science Database, from 1945 to 2015]. , Universidade Tecnol\u00f3gica Federal do Paran\u00e1.", "type": "Publication", "Link": "http://repositorio.utfpr.edu.br/jspui/handle/1/3552", "label": "[Portuguese] A Desonestidade Cient\u00edfica e seu Reflexo na Retrata\u00e7\u00e3o de Artigos Indexados na Base Web of Science, no Per\u00edodo de 1945 a 2015 [Scientific Dishonesty and its Impact on the Retraction of Articles Indexed in the Web of Science Database, from 1945 to 2015]", "author": ["Rubbo Priscila"], "id": 58891667, "pub-type": "Dissertation", "year": "2018", "Processes_and_policies": ["Analysis of reasons for retraction", "Retracting authorities", "Time to retraction"], "Other": ["Retraction rates over time", "Reviews of the literature ABOUT retraction"], "Database_search_limitations": ["Database source--field limitation", "Database source--start date limitation (not from database inception)"], "Studies_related_to_discipline_or_geography": ["Field-specific study (including systematic reviews)", "Geography as a finding"], "Citation_of_retracted_papers": "Citation as focus--particular field of study", "Citation_context": "Citation--context not explored", "Characteristics_of_retracted_papers": "Retracted papers--impact factor and related metrics of journals", "Language": "Portuguese"}, {"Codes": [{"AttributeId": 9094964, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9094966, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095038, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9302136, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9564478, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}], "Outcomes": [], "ShortTitle": "Rubbo (2019)", "DateCreated": "21/04/2020", "CreatedBy": "Randi Proescholdt", "DateEdited": "02/07/2021", "EditedBy": "Katherine Howell", "Month": "November", "StandardNumber": "WOS:000488463600005 ER", "City": "", "Country": "", "Publisher": "", "Institution": "", "Volume": "29", "Pages": "661-679.", "Edition": "", "Issue": "(8),", "Availability": "", "URL": "", "OldItemId": "", "Abstract": "The objective of this study is to compare the quantity of citations that retracted and nonretracted articles received in engineering based on articles indexed in the Web of Science database and published between 1945 and 2015.

Yuhji Saitoh has coauthored many articles with Yoshitaka Fujii which were subsequently retracted. Japanese Society of Anesthesiology (JSA) recommends retraction of various articles by Yuhji Saitoh, but various attributes of those and their retraction notices have not been examined. Methods: A list of retracted articles was retrieved from PubMed, Retraction Watch Database and relevant journals. Their retraction notices were obtained from the journal's webpage. Predefined characteristics of the retracted articles and their retraction notices were evaluated against those proposed by Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). Results: Fifteen such articles were retracted. Two of them were not identified as retracted in the journal webpage. Half of the papers mentioned by JSA are yet to be retracted. Among those retracted, only 13.3% retraction notices were in line with the guidelines published by the COPE. Two retracted articles are yet to be flagged as retracted in PubMed. The median (interquartile range) time required for retraction from the date of declaration of being eligible for retraction is 14 (3) months. Data were analysed with Microsoft Excel\u2122 (2007). Conclusion: Even after more than 1 year of recommendation, many articles containing evidence of scientific misconduct are yet to be retracted. Among those retracted, the relevant authority failed to follow the prevalent and well-regarded standards of ethics in scholarly publication. \u00a9 2019 Indian Journal of Anaesthesia | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.", "Comments": "Cited By :1 | Export Date: 21 April 2020", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.4103/ija.IJA_267_19", "Keywords": "Committee on Publication Ethics\r\nresearch misconduct\r\nretracted publication\r\nretraction notice\r\nanesthesiology\r\narticle\r\nethics\r\nhuman\r\nMedline\r\npractice guideline\r\nretraction notice\r\nscientific misconduct\r\nsystematic review", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Saikia Priyam, and Thakuria Bandana (2019) Retraction of papers authored by Yuhji Saitoh - beyond the Fujii phenomenon.

At the same time, the quality of systematic reviews can be affected by misconduct in primary publications.\n\nObjective: To describe several cases of serious duplicate publication detected as a result of a Cochrane Review, raising potential synergies between publishers and Cochrane.\n\nMethods: The results of a search in a Cochrane Review on hypertension were independently assessed by authors in pairs and a serious case of duplicate publication was identified. On that basis, we searched for all randomized controlled trials (RCT) published by the main author involved in PubMed (accessed on 20 September 2015) and double checked them to exclude additional cases of plagiarism.\n\nResults: As a result of peer-review tasks in a Cochrane Review, we considered eight articles about 2 RCT authored by the same first author as potential duplicate publications. After contacting the publishers, six articles were retracted.Then we retrieved 129 RCT published by this researcher from the PubMed database, 86 as first author. A total of 47 RCT articles (54.7%), including the eight RCT previously identified, were considered as potential duplicate publications (Table 1). The 47 RCT included antidiabetics, antihypertensives and anti-obesity drugs, were published from 2004-2014, and came from 17 different studies. We informed all the 26 journals affected (linked to 10 publishers) in October 2015. As of 20 April 2016, only one additional retraction was confirmed.(http://retractionwatch.com/2016/02/12/investigation-leads-to-5th-retraction-for-drug-researcher). Three journals decided not to retract on the basis of first copyright and the other three journals considered the potential duplicate content as acceptable. The rest of investigations were still ongoing.\n\nConclusions: A comprehensive information retrieval and a peer-review methodology are strong points for Cochrane Reviews.

It is unclear how broadly the issue of misleading and fraudulent publications pertains to retractions of drug therapy studies. Therefore, we sought to determine the trends and factors associated with retracted publications in drug therapy literature. A PubMed search was conducted to identify retracted drug therapy articles published from 2000-2011. Articles were grouped according to reason for retraction, which was classified as scientific misconduct or error. Scientific misconduct was further divided into data fabrication, data falsification, questions of data veracity, unethical author conduct, and plagiarism. Error was defined as duplicate publication, scientific mistake, journal error, or unstated reasons. Additional data were extracted from the retracted articles, including type of article, funding source, author information, therapeutic area, and retraction issue. A total of 742 retractions were identified from 2000-2011 in the general biomedical literature, and 102 drug studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 73 articles (72%) were retracted for a reason classified as scientific misconduct, whereas 29 articles (28%) were retracted for error. Among the 73 articles classified as scientific misconduct, those classified as unethical author conduct (32 articles [44%]) and data fabrication (24 articles [33%]) constituted the majority. The median time from publication of the original article to retraction was 31 months (range 1-130). Fifty percent of retracted articles did not state a funding source, whereas pharmaceutical manufacturer funding accounted for only 13 articles (13%) analyzed. Many retractions were due to repeat offenses by a small number of authors, with nearly 40% of the retracted studies associated with two individuals.

In the modern tech-savvy era, scientific literature publication remains the optimal way to disperse knowledge, even if it has transformed from print to mostly electronic. With the new and improved publication methods, also come more scrutiny and analytic criticism of the scientific work. It becomes even more important in this context to rectify flawed scientific work responsibly. This present study was undertaken to help clarify the process and causes of retractions occurring in the dental community and analyse its reasons. Methodology. A total of 8092 PubMed indexed articles were scanned from the online libraries, and individually scanning for author details, place of study, subspecialty of research, funding, dates of original publication, and retraction notices issued along with journal specifics such as type and impact factors, country of publishing was compiled and analysed by two authors. The dataset was then collaboratively analysed using Panda's Library in Python software as an analysis tool for data preparation and for frequency analysis. The estimates were presented as mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results. The present study had a compiled dataset of 198 articles after screening and revealed that maximum retractions of dentistry-related research originated from India (25.3%) and, on average, took 2.6 years to be issued a retraction notice. We also deciphered that the USA retracted maximum dental articles (34.8%), and plagiarism was cited as the most common (38.02%) reason for doing so. The present study also brought to light that there was a trend for lower impact factor-dental journals in retracting maximum articles, most of which were nonfunded (62.16%). The results signify that 63.78% of all retracted papers continued to be cited postretractions. Conclusions. The retractions happening in the field of dental literature are currently too time-consuming and often unclear to the readers. The authors would like to conclude that the retracted papers were mostly from India and Spain mostly related to endodontics or prosthodontic research. All of this warrants the need for better scrutiny and reforms in the area.", "Comments": "Export Date: 28 January 2021", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8881352", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Samuel Shannon, Cherian Joe Mathew, and Thomas Abi M (2020) Comprehensive analysis of retracted publications in dentistry: A 23-year review.

Answering such questions may improve our understanding of risk perceptions of some publicly controversial technologies, for example, childhood vaccines and genetically modified (GM) food. We engage with the social amplification of risk framework, especially scholarship on news media as a risk amplification (or attenuation) station. In a between-subjects experiment, we examine the extent to which perceived risk of GM food is influenced by (a) news of a study reporting that eating GM food causes cancer and/or (b) news of its retraction.

In Japan, the valsartan scandal was a significant event all 5 key articles on the valsartan clinical trials were retracted after the revelation of data falsification. Consequently, the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association issued transparency guidelines, and pharmaceutical payments have been publicly disclosed since 2013. However, the distribution of payments from pharmaceutical companies among authors involved in the valsartan scandal after its revelation has not been studied to date. OBJECTIVE To identify the characteristics and distribution of payments from pharmaceutical companies to researchers involved in the valsartan scandal in Japan by using a comprehensive payment database. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cross-sectional study, conducted from January 1, 2016, through September 30, 2017, used information on payments from 78 pharmaceutical companies to 50 authors of 5 articles retracted after the valsartan scandal the Kyoto Heart Study, Jikei Heart Study, SMART (Shiga Microalbuminuria Reduction Trial), VART (Valsartan Amlodipine Randomized Trial), and Nagoya Heart Study. Payments from companies to physicians were analyzed during the period from January 1, 2016, to September 30, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcomes were the amount and proportion of payments made by pharmaceutical companies to authors, and the forms of these payments. RESULTS Of 50 eligible authors, 30 (60%) received payments from pharmaceutical companies in 2016. The payments in the Japanese yen totaled (sic)67.15 million (US $590?896) and the mean (SD) payment was more than (sic)1.34 million ((sic)3.01 million) (US $11?817 [$27 292]). Five authors (10%) received more than (sic)5 million (US $44?000) and 3 authors (6%) received more than (sic)10 million (US $88?000). The total payments to the corresponding author of each article was (sic)29 million (US $255?307), accounting for 43.2% of the total payments. Regarding forms of the payments, lecture fees accounted for 81.3% of the total payment ((sic)54.56 million). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Many authors involved in the valsartan scandal received payments from the pharmaceutical industry. Although whether such payments to these authors have decreased since the scandal is unclear, the findings appear to demonstrate that their financial relationships with the industry are still prominent. The findings of the study appear to support the need to encourage more transparency in such relationships because misconduct can occur within unclear relationships.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.3817", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Sawano Toyoaki, Ozaki Akihiko, Saito Hiroaki, Shimada Yuki, and Tanimoto Tetsuya (2019) Payments from pharmaceutical companies to authors involved in the valsartan scandal in Japan.

Eleven years after its retraction, the paper continues to be cited positively and uncritically to support a medical nutrition intervention, without mention of its 2008 retraction for falsifying data. To date no high quality clinical trials reporting on the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids on reducing inflammatory markers have been published. Our paper uses network analysis, citation context analysis, and retraction status visibility analysis to illustrate the potential for extended propagation of misinformation over a citation network, updating and extending a case study of the first 6 years of post-retraction citation (Fulton et al. in Publications 3(1):7\u201326, 2015. https://doi.org/10.3390/publications3010017). The current study covers 148 direct citations from 2006 through 2019 and their 2542 second-generation citations and assesses retraction status visibility of the case study paper and its retraction notice on 12 digital platforms as of 2020. The retraction is not mentioned in 96% (107/112) of direct post-retraction citations for which we were able to conduct citation context analysis. Over 41% (44/107) of direct post-retraction citations that do not mention the retraction describe the case study paper in detail, giving a risk of diffusing misinformation from the case paper. We analyze 152 second-generation citations to the most recent 35 direct citations (2010\u20132019) that do not mention the retraction but do mention methods or results of the case paper, finding 23 possible diffusions of misinformation from these non-direct citations to the case paper. Link resolving errors from databases show a significant challenge in a reader reaching the retraction notice via a database search.

However, the FDA has no systematic method of communicating these findings to the scientific community, leaving open the possibility that research misconduct detected by a government agency goes unremarked in the peer-reviewed literature. OBJECTIVES: To identify published clinical trials in which an FDA inspection found significant evidence of objectionable conditions or practices, to describe violations, and to determine whether the violations are mentioned in the peer-reviewed literature. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional analysis of publicly available documents, dated from January 1, 1998, to September 30, 2013, describing FDA inspections of clinical trial sites in which significant evidence of objectionable conditions or practices was found. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For each inspection document that could be linked to a specific published clinical trial, the main measure was a yes/no determination of whether there was mention in the peer-reviewed literature of problems the FDA had identified. RESULTS: Fifty-seven published clinical trials were identified for which an FDA inspection of a trial site had found significant evidence of 1 or more of the following problems: falsification or submission of false information, 22 trials (39%); problems with adverse events reporting, 14 trials (25%); protocol violations, 42 trials (74%); inadequate or inaccurate recordkeeping, 35 trials (61%); failure to protect the safety of patients and/or issues with oversight or informed consent, 30 trials (53%); and violations not otherwise categorized, 20 trials (35%). Only 3 of the 78 publications (4%) that resulted from trials in which the FDA found significant violations mentioned the objectionable conditions or practices found during the inspection. No corrections, retractions, expressions of concern, or other comments acknowledging the key issues identified by the inspection were subsequently published. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: When the FDA finds significant departures from good clinical practice, those findings are seldom reflected in the peer-reviewed literature, even when there is evidence of data fabrication or other forms of research misconduct.

However, the extent to which researchers and the public are made adequately aware of these retractions and how the media and social media respond to them remains unknown. Here, we aimed to evaluate the media and social media attention received by retracted articles and assess also the attention they receive post-retraction versus pre-retraction. We downloaded all records of retracted literature maintained by the Retraction Watch Database and originally published between January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015. For all 3,008 retracted articles with a separate DOI for the original and its retraction, we downloaded the respective Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) (from Altmetric) and citation count (from Crossref), for the original article and its retraction notice on June 6, 2018. We also compared the AAS of a random sample of 572 retracted full journal articles available on PubMed to that of unretracted full articles matched from the same issue and journal. 1,687 (56.1%) of retracted research articles received some amount of Altmetric attention, and 165 (5.5%) were even considered popular (AAS>20). 31 (1.0%) of 2,953 with a record on Crossref received >100 citations by June 6, 2018. Popular articles received substantially more attention than their retraction, even after adjusting for attention received post-retraction (Median difference, 29; 95% CI, 17\u201361). Unreliable results were the most frequent reason for retraction of popular articles (32; 19%), while fake peer review was the most common reason (421; 15%) for the retraction of other articles. In comparison to matched articles, retracted articles tended to receive more Altmetric attention (23/31 matched groups; P-value, 0.01), even after adjusting for attention received post-retraction.

The study demonstrates the collaboration patterns of retracted publications where 61.5% of authors have only one and 24.6% have two retracted papers; however, 2% of authors have more than retracted papers. Also, the temporal evolution of the team size reveals that teams smaller in size have more retractions. The impact of citing retracted papers reveals that 55.2% of retracted papers have been cited at least once. 1/4th of the citations to the retracted papers are self-citations which themselves are retractions. On average 71.4% citations are the non-retracted citations and 28.6% citations are retracted citations which are mostly the self-citations. Last, the variation in average team size and average retracted citations in various research areas (having high retraction) is presented.

To find these determinants we compared two samples, one of retractions with top altmetric attention scores and one of retractions with altmetric attention scores chosen at random.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the retraction status and reasons of non-Cochrane SRs in medicine.\nMethods\nWe searched MEDLINE and Embase from their inception until April 18, 2020, as well as Retraction Watch Database and Google Scholar with no language restriction to find non-Cochrane SRs that were retracted for any reason. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data. We described the characteristic and reasons of retraction and the duration from publication to retraction.\nResults\nWe identified 150 non-Cochrane SRs in medicine retracted between 2004 and 2020. The majority of retracted SRs were led by authors from China (n=113, 75.3%) and affiliated with hospitals (n=106, 70.7%). Most SRs were published in journals with an impact factor \u22643 (n=85, 56.7%). The largest proportion of retraction notices were issued by the publisher and editor(s) jointly (n=60, 40.0%); seven did not report this information. Fraudulent peer-review (n=61, 37.9%) was the most common reason for retraction, followed by unreliable data (n=41, 25.5%) meaning errors in study selection or data analysis. The median time between publication and retraction was 14.0 months. SRs retracted due to research misconduct took longer to retract than SRs retracted because of honest error.\nConclusions\n\ufeffThe situation with retracted SRs is critical worldwide, and in particular in China. The most common reasons for retraction are fraudulent peer-review and unreliable data, and in most cases the study is retracted more than a year after publication. Efforts should be made to improve the process of peer review and adherence to the COPE retraction guidance, and authors should strengthen their skills in SR methodology.", "Comments": "Preprint; FIX AUTHOR LIST", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-125016/v1", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Shi Qianling, Wang Zijun, Zhou Qi, Hou Ruizhen, Gao Xia, He Shaoe, Zhao Siya, Ma Yanfang, Zhang Xianzhuo, Guan Quanlin, and Chen Yaolong (2020) An overview of retraction status and reasons of non-Cochrane systematic reviews in medicine [preprint, Research Square]. : ,  DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-125016/v1", "type": "Publication", "Link": "http://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-125016/v1", "label": "An overview of retraction status and reasons of non-Cochrane systematic reviews in medicine [preprint, Research Square]", "author": ["Shi Qianling", "Wang Zijun", "Zhou Qi", "Hou Ruizhen", "Gao Xia", "He Shaoe", "Zhao Siya", "Ma Yanfang", "Zhang Xianzhuo", "Guan Quanlin", "Chen Yaolong"], "id": 58768873, "pub-type": "Report", "year": "2020", "Processes_and_policies": ["Analysis of reasons for retraction", "Retracting authorities", "Time to retraction"], "Characteristics_of_retracted_papers": ["Retracted papers--document/study characteristics", "Retracted papers--funding/sponsorship/affiliation", "Retracted papers--impact factor and related metrics of journals"], "Studies_related_to_discipline_or_geography": ["Geography as a finding", "Field-specific study (including systematic reviews)"], "Database_search_limitations": "Database source--document type or study design limitation", "Language": "English"}, {"Codes": [{"AttributeId": 9095036, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095039, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095054, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095063, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9302136, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9426260, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9094960, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095059, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9564478, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9613657, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}], "Outcomes": [], "ShortTitle": "Shuai (2017)", "DateCreated": "26/08/2018", "CreatedBy": "Jodi Schneider", "DateEdited": "08/09/2021", "EditedBy": "Jodi Schneider", "Month": "", "StandardNumber": "", "City": "", "Country": "", "Publisher": "", "Institution": "", "Volume": "68", "Pages": "2225-2236.", "Edition": "", "Issue": "(9),", "Availability": "", "URL": "https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23826", "OldItemId": "", "Abstract": "During the past few decades, the rate of publication retractions has increased dramatically in academia. In this study, we investigate retractions from a quantitative perspective, aiming to answer two fundamental ques-tions. One, how do retractions influence the scholarly impact of retracted papers, authors, and institutions? Two, does this influence propagate to the wider academ-ic community through scholarly associations? Specifi-cally, we analyzed a set of retracted articles indexed in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS), and ran multi-ple experiments to compare changes in scholarly impact against a control set of nonretracted articles, authors, and institutions. We further applied the Granger Causality test to investigate whether different scientific topics are dynamically affected by retracted papers occurring within those topics. Our results show two key findings: first, the scholarly impact of retracted papers and authors significantly decreases after retrac-tion, and the most severe impact decrease correlates with retractions based on proven, purposeful scientific misconduct; second, this retraction penalty does not seem to spread through the broader scholarly social graph, but instead has a limited and localized effect. Our findings may provide useful insights for scholars or sci-ence committees to evaluate the scholarly value of papers, authors, or institutions related to retractions.", "Comments": "Uses Wikipedia data.", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1002/asi.23826", "Keywords": "Retraction rate\nField differences", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Shuai Xin, Rollins Jason, Moulinier Isabelle, Custis Tonya, Edmunds Mathilda, and Schilder Frank (2017) A multidimensional investigation of the effects of publication retraction on scholarly impact.

Indeed, the scientific method itself is intended to overcome mistakes and misdeeds. So, we aimed to assess various factors associated with retraction of scientific articles from 2004 to 2013. Data were retrieved from PubMed and Medline using the keywords retraction of articles, retraction notice, and withdrawal of article in April 2014 to detect articles retracted from 2004 to 2013. Statistical analysis was carried out using t-test and Karl Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results showed that a total of 2343 articles were retracted between 2004 and 2013, and original articles followed by case reports constituted major part of it. Time interval between submission and retraction of article has reduced in recent times. Impact factor and retraction do not have any significant correlation. We conclude that although retraction of articles is a rare event, its constant rise in scientific literature is quite worrisome. It is still unclear whether misconduct/mistakes in articles are increasing hastily or the articles are retracted at a rapid rate in recent times. So, it should be considered as an urgent issue and it is the responsibility of journal editors to track misconduct by following Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) guidelines and making an effective strategy.

Despite a rigorous reviewing process, certain articles undergo retraction due to disclosure of their ethical or scientific deficiencies. It is, therefore, important to understand how society and academia react to the erroneous or deceitful claims and purge the science of their unreliable results. Applying a matched-pairs research design, this study examined a sample of medicine-related retracted and non-retracted articles matched by their content similarity. The regression analysis revealed similarities in obsolescence trends of the retracted and non-retracted groups. The Generalized Estimating Equations showed that citations are affected by the retraction status, life after retraction, life cycle and the journals\u2019 previous reputation, with the two formers being the strongest in positively predicting the citations. The retracted papers obtain fewer citations either before or after retraction, implying academia\u2019s watchful reaction to the low-quality papers even before official announcement of their fallibility. They exhibit an equal or higher social recognition level regarding Tweets and Blog Mentions, while a lower status regarding Mendeley Readership. This could signify social users\u2019 sensibility regarding scientific quality since they probably publicise the retraction and warn against the retracted items in their tweets or blogs, while avoiding recording them in their Mendeley profiles. Further scrutiny is required to gain insight into the sensibility, if any, about scientific quality. The study\u2019s originality relies on matching the retracted and non-retracted papers with their topics and neutralising variations in their citation potentials.

In the past few years, financial support for health research in emerging countries has steadily increased, resulting in a growing number of scientific publications. These achievements, however, have been accompanied by a rise in retracted publications followed by concerns about the quality and reliability of such publications. Objective This systematic review aimed to investigate the profile of medical and life sciences research retractions from authors affiliated with Brazilian academic institutions. The chronological trend between publication and retraction date, reasons for the retraction, citation of the article after the retraction, study design, and the number of retracted publications by author and affiliation were assessed. Additionally, the quality, availability and accessibility of data regarding retracted papers from the publishers are described. Methods Two independent reviewers searched for articles that had been retracted since 2004 via PubMed, Web of Science, Biblioteca Virtual em Sa\u00fade (BVS) and Google Scholar databases. Indexed keywords from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Descritores em Ci\u00eancias da Sa\u00fade (DeCS) in Portuguese, English or Spanish were used. Data were also collected from the Retraction Watch website (www.retractionwatch.com). This study was registered with the PROSPERO systematic review database (CRD42017071647). Results A final sample of 65 articles was retrieved from 55 different journals with reported impact factors ranging from 0 to 32.86, with a median value of 4.40 and a mean of 4.69. The types of documents found were erratum (1), retracted articles (3), retracted articles with a retraction notice (5), retraction notices with erratum (3), and retraction notices (45). The assessment of the Retraction Watch website added 8 articles that were not identified by the search strategy using the bibliographic databases. The retracted publications covered a wide range of study designs. Experimental studies (40) and literature reviews (15) accounted for 84.6% of the retracted articles. Within the field of health and life sciences, medical science was the field with the largest number of retractions (34), followed by biological sciences (17). Some articles were retracted for at least two distinct reasons (13). Among the retrieved articles, plagiarism was the main reason for retraction (60%). Missing data were found in 57% of the retraction notices, which was a limitation to this review. In addition, 63% of the articles were cited after their retraction. Conclusion Publications are not retracted solely for research misconduct but also for honest error. Nevertheless, considering authors affiliated with Brazilian institutions, this review concluded that most of the retracted health and life sciences publications were retracted due to research misconduct. Because the number of publications is the most valued indicator of scientific productivity for funding and career progression purposes, a systematic effort from the national research councils, funding agencies, universities and scientific journals is needed to avoid an escalating trend of research misconduct. More investigations are needed to comprehend the underlying factors of research misconduct and its increasing manifestation. \u00a9 2019 Stavale et al.

Patient risk could arise in a retracted primary study or in any secondary study that draws ideas or inspiration from a primary study. METHODS: To determine how many patients were put at risk, we evaluated 788 retracted English-language papers published from 2000 to 2010, describing new research with humans or freshly derived human material. These primary papers-together with all secondary studies citing them-were evaluated using ISI Web of Knowledge. Excluded from study were 468 basic science papers not studying fresh human material; 88 reviews presenting older data; 22 case reports; 7 papers retracted for journal error and 23 papers unavailable on Web of Knowledge. Overall, 180 retracted primary papers (22.8%) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects enrolled and patients treated in 180 primary studies and 851 secondary studies were combined. RESULTS: Retracted papers were cited over 5000 times, with 93% of citations being research related, suggesting that ideas promulgated in retracted papers can influence subsequent research. Over 28 000 subjects were enrolled-and 9189 patients were treated-in 180 retracted primary studies. Over 400 000 subjects were enrolled-and 70 501 patients were treated-in 851 secondary studies which cited a retracted paper. Papers retracted for fraud (n=70) treated more patients per study (p<0.01) than papers retracted for error (n=110). CONCLUSIONS: Many patients are put at risk by retracted studies.

Growing attention to fraud in the lay press suggests that the incidence of fraud is increasing. METHODS: The reasons for retracting 742 English language research papers retracted from the PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Reasons for retraction were initially dichotomised as fraud or error and then analysed to determine specific reasons for retraction. RESULTS: Error was more common than fraud (73.5% of papers were retracted for error (or an undisclosed reason) vs 26.6% retracted for fraud). Eight reasons for retraction were identified; the most common reason was scientific mistake in 234 papers (31.5%), but 134 papers (18.1%) were retracted for ambiguous reasons. Fabrication (including data plagiarism) was more common than text plagiarism. Total papers retracted per year have increased sharply over the decade (r=0.96; p<0.001), as have retractions specifically for fraud (r=0.89; p<0.001). Journals now reach farther back in time to retract, both for fraud (r=0.87; p<0.001) and for scientific mistakes (r=0.95; p<0.001). Journals often fail to alert the naive reader; 31.8% of retracted papers were not noted as retracted in any way. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of misconduct appear to be higher than in the past. This may reflect either a real increase in the incidence of fraud or a greater effort on the part of journals to police the literature.

It is hypothesised that fraudulent authors target journals with a high impact factor (IF), have other fraudulent publications, diffuse responsibility across many co-authors, delay retracting fraudulent papers and publish from countries with a weak research infrastructure. Methods All 788 English language research papers retracted from the PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Data pertinent to each retracted paper were abstracted from the paper and the reasons for retraction were derived from the retraction notice and dichotomised as fraud or error. Data for each retracted article were entered in an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. Results Journal IF was higher for fraudulent papers (p<0.001). Roughly 53% of fraudulent papers were written by a first author who had written other retracted papers ('repeat offender'), whereas only 18% of erroneous papers were written by a repeat offender (chi=88.40; p<0.0001). Fraudulent papers had more authors (p<0.001) and were retracted more slowly than erroneous papers (p<0.005). Surprisingly, there was significantly more fraud than error among retracted papers from the USA (chi(2)=8.71; p<0.05) compared with the rest of the world. Conclusions This study reports evidence consistent with the 'deliberate fraud' hypothesis. The results suggest that papers retracted because of data fabrication or falsification represent a calculated effort to deceive.

If misinformation is due to inadvertent (random) error--rather than to deliberate (nonrandom) fraud--then it may not be possible to prevent misinformation. I hypothesized that misconduct severe enough to result in article retraction reflects inadvertent error and should be randomly distributed in the literature. I evaluated all English-language research articles retracted in the PubMed database from 2000 to 2010. Of 4.8 million articles published, a total of 788 (0.016%) were retracted; for every 6,109 articles published, 1 article was retracted, suggesting that misinformation is rare. However, there are striking trends in retraction. In 2000, 4 articles were retracted and the longest time to retraction was 8 months; in 2004, 49 articles were retracted and the longest time to retraction was 50 months; in 2009, 184 articles were retracted and the longest time to retraction was 117 months. Furthermore, retractions are not randomly distributed in the literature. Retractions tend to appear in journals with an impact factor significantly above average. Retractions are also significantly clustered in a specific subset of journals and are written by a specific subset of \"repeat offender\" authors.

OBJECTIVE: To explore hypotheses that more patients are put at risk if a retracted paper appears in a journal with a high impact factor (IF) so that the paper is widely read; is written by a 'repeat offender' author who has produced other retracted research; or is a clinical trial. METHODS: English language papers (n=788) retracted from the PubMed database between 2000 and 2010 were evaluated. Only those papers retracting research with humans or freshly derived human material were included; 180 retracted primary papers (22.8%) met inclusion criteria. Subjects enrolled and patients treated were tallied, both in the retracted primary studies and in 851 secondary studies that cited a retracted primary paper. RESULTS: Retracted papers published in high-IF journals were cited more often (p=0.0004) than those in low-IF journals, but there was no difference between high- and low-IF papers in subjects enrolled or patients treated. Retracted papers published by 'repeat offender' authors did not enrol more subjects or treat more patients than papers by one-time offenders, nor was there a difference in number of citations. However, retracted clinical trials treated more patients (p=0.0002) and inspired secondary studies that put more patients at risk (p=0.0019) than did other kinds of medical research. CONCLUSIONS: If the goal is to minimise risk to patients, the appropriate focus is on clinical trials.

Methods and Findings We examined the interval between publication and retraction for 2,047 retracted articles indexed in PubMed. Time-to-retraction (from publication of article to publication of retraction) averaged 32.91 months. Among 714 retracted articles published in or before 2002, retraction required 49.82 months; among 1,333 retracted articles published after 2002, retraction required 23.82 months (p\\textless0.0001). This suggests that journals are retracting papers more quickly than in the past, although recent articles requiring retraction may not have been recognized yet. To test the hypothesis that time-to-retraction is shorter for articles that receive careful scrutiny, time-to-retraction was correlated with journal impact factor (IF). Time-to-retraction was significantly shorter for high-IF journals, but only \u223c1% of the variance in time-to-retraction was explained by increased scrutiny. The first article retracted for plagiarism was published in 1979 and the first for duplicate publication in 1990, showing that articles are now retracted for reasons not cited in the past. The proportional impact of authors with multiple retractions was greater in 1972\u20131992 than in the current era (p\\textless0.001). From 1972\u20131992, 46.0% of retracted papers were written by authors with a single retraction; from 1993 to 2012, 63.1% of retracted papers were written by single-retraction authors (p\\textless0.001). Conclusions The increase in retracted articles appears to reflect changes in the behavior of both authors and institutions. Lower barriers to publication of flawed articles are seen in the increase in number and proportion of retractions by authors with a single retraction. Lower barriers to retraction are apparent in an increase in retraction for \u201cnew\u201d offenses such as plagiarism and a decrease in the time-to-retraction of flawed work.", "Comments": "See also correction", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068397", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Steen R Grant, Casadevall Arturo, and Fang Ferric C (2013) Why has the number of scientific retractions increased?.

We test a hypothesis that variables in the results section of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are associated with retraction, even without access to raw data. We evaluated all English-language RCTs retracted from the PubMed database prior to 2011. Two controls were selected for each case, matching publication journal, volume, issue, and page as closely as possible. Number of authors, subjects enrolled, patients at risk, and patients treated were tallied in cases and controls. Among case RCTs, 17.5% had \u22642 authors, while 6.3% of control RCTs had \u22642 authors. Logistic regression shows that having few authors is associated with retraction (p &lt; 0.03), although the number of subjects enrolled, patients at risk, or treated patients is not. However, none of the variables singly, nor all of the variables combined, can reliably predict retraction, perhaps because retraction is such a rare event. Exploratory analysis suggests that retraction rate varies by medical field (p &lt; 0.001). Although retraction cannot be predicted on the basis of the variables evaluated, concern is warranted when there are few authors, enrolled subjects, patients at risk, or treated patients.

Do biomedical journals differ from the journals from other disciplines in that respect? Our hypothesis was that biomedical journals maintain much higher publication ethics standards. Materials and methods: This study looked at 197 Croatian OA journals Instructions to authors to address the following groups of ethical issues: general terms; guidelines and recommendations; research approval and registration; funding and conflict of interest; peer review; redundant publications, misconduct and retraction; copyright; timeliness; authorship; and data accessibility. We further compared a subset of 159 non-biomedical journals with a subset of 38 biomedical journals. Content analysis was used to discern the ethical issues representation in the instructions to authors. Results: The groups of biomedical and non-biomedical journals were similar in terms of originality (\u03c72= 2.183, P = 0.140), peer review process (\u03c72= 0.296, P = 0.586), patent/grant statement (\u03c72= 2.184, P = 0.141), and timeliness of publication (\u03c72= 0.369, P = 0.544). We identified significant differences among categories including ethical issues typical for the field of biomedicine, like patients (\u03c72= 47.111, P &lt; 0.001), and use of experimental animals (\u03c72= 42.543, P &lt; 0.001). Biomedical journals also rely on international editorial guidelines formulated by relevant professional organizations heavily, compared with non-biomedical journals (\u03c72= 42.666, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Low representation or absence of some key ethical issues in author guidelines calls for more attention to the structure and the content of Instructions to authors in Croatian OA journals. \u00a9 by Croatian Society of Medical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine", "Comments": "Cited By :8 | Export Date: 19 July 2018 | Correspondence Address: Stojanovski, J.; University of ZadarCroatia; email: jstojanovski@unizd.hr | References: Ware, M., Mabe, M., (2012), 68p. http://www.stm-assoc.org/2012_12_11_STM_Report_2012.pdf, The stm report, Available at:, Accessed December 22, 2014; Bjork, B., Solomon, D., (2014) Developing an Effective Market for Open Access Article Processing Charges, 70p. , https://www.fwf.ac.at/fileadmin/files/Dokumente/Downloads/Dev_Effective_Market_OA_Article_Processing_Charges.pdf, Available at:, Accessed December 22, 2014; De Rond, M., Publish or Perish: Bane or Boon of Academic Life?

Secondary objectives included investigating other factors associated with plagiarism (e.g., national language of the first author's country affiliation, publication type, journal ranking). DESIGN: Systematic, controlled, retrospective, bibliometric study. DATA SOURCE: Retracted publications dataset in MEDLINE (search filters: English, human, January 1966-February 2008). DATA SELECTION: Retracted misconduct publications were classified according to the first author's country affiliation, country income level, and country national language, publication type, and ranking of the publishing journal. Standardised definitions and data collection tools were used; data were analysed (odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence limits [CL], chi-squared tests) by an independent academic statistician. RESULTS: Of the 213 retracted misconduct publications, 41.8% (89/213) were retracted for plagiarism, 52.1% (111/213) for falsification/fabrication, 2.3% (5/213) for author disputes, 2.3% (5/213) for ethical issues, and 1.4% (3/213) for unknown reasons. The OR (95% CL) of plagiarism retractions (other misconduct retractions as reference) were higher (P < 0.001) for first authors affiliated with lower-income versus higher-income countries (15.4 [4.5, 52.9]) and with non-English versus English national language countries (3.2 [1.8, 5.7]), for non-original research versus original research publications (8.4 [3.3, 21.3]), for case reports and series versus other original research types (4.2 [1.4, 13.0]), and for publications in low-ranked versus high-ranked journals (4.9 [2.4, 9.9]). Up until 2012, there were significantly (P < 0.007) fewer 'serial offenders' (first authors with >1 retraction) with publications retracted for plagiarism (11.5%, 9/78) than other types of misconduct (28.9%, 24/83). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that publications retracted for plagiarism are significantly associated with first authors affiliated with lower-income countries.

In our systematic review, we identified 16 studies reporting prevalence estimates of scientific misconduct and questionable research practices (QRPs) in psychological research. Estimates from these studies varied due to differences in methods and scope. Unlike other disciplines, there was no reliable lower bound prevalence estimate of scientific misconduct based on identified cases available for psychology. Thus, we conducted an additional empirical investigation on the basis of retractions in the database PsycINFO. Our analyses showed that 0.82 per 10,000 journal articles in psychology were retracted due to scientific misconduct. Between the late 1990s and 2012, there was a steep increase. Articles retracted due to scientific misconduct were identified in 20 out of 22 PsycINFO subfields. These results show that measures aiming to reduce scientific misconduct should be promoted equally across all psychological subfields.", "Comments": "JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1027/2151-2604/a000356", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Stricker Johannes, and G\u00fcnther Armin (2019) Scientific misconduct in psychology: A systematic review of prevalence estimates and new empirical data.

The article by Wakefield et al that fraudulently reported an association between vaccination and autism continues to accumulate citations even after it was retracted. OBJECTIVES To examine the characteristics of citations from scholarly literature that reference the 1998 article by Wakefield et al and to investigate whether authors are accurately citing retracted references. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional bibliographic analysis of the scholarly publications that cited a 1998 article by Wakefield et al, cited references were collected from a Web of Science Core Collection search performed on March 11, 2019. A total of 1211 articles were identified, with 58 citing works excluded because they were non-English-language publications or the citation to the study by Wakefield et al could not be located by reviewers. Citing works consisted of books, research articles, letters, editorials, news items, and other scholarly literature. Citations to the article by Wakefield et al were identified and analyzed by 2 reviewers in a blinded screening. Reviewers assigned a characteristic to each citation and indicated whether the retraction was documented. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The characteristics of citations to the article by Wakefield et al, were categorized as negative, affirmative, or contrastive; if not, persuasive; and if not, assumptive, perfunctory, methodologic, or conceptual. Whether the partial retraction or notice of retraction was included in the citing work was also documented. RESULTS Among the 1153 citing works included in this analysis, the most common citation characteristics were negative (838 [72.7%]) followed by perfunctory (106 [9.2%]) and affirmative (94 [8.2%]). A total of 123 of 322 citing works (38.2%) published between 2005 and 2010 documented the partial retraction. After the notof retraction was published in 2010, the percentage of citing works that documented the partial retraction and/or notice of retraction between 2011 and 2018 increased to 360 of 502 (71.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Since the article by Wakefield et al was initially published, authors have mostly negated the findings of the study. A significant number of authors did not document retractions of the article by Wakefield et al. The findings suggest that improvements are needed from publishers, bibliographic databases, and citation management software to ensure that retracted articles are accurately documented.", "Comments": "Earlier presentation from this work in Suelzer E.

This study investigated the discussions on STAP cells on Twitter and content of newspaper articles in an attempt to assess the role of social compared with traditional media in scientific peer review. Objective: This study examined Twitter utilization in scientific peer review on STAP cells misconduct. Methods: Searches for tweets and newspaper articles containing the term \"STAP cells\" were carried out through Twitter's search engine and Nikkei Telecom database, respectively. The search period was from January 1 to July 1, 2014. The nouns appearing in the \"top tweets\" and newspaper articles were extracted through a morphological analysis, and their frequency of appearance and changes over time were investigated. Results: The total numbers of top tweets and newspaper articles containing the term were 134,958 and 1646, respectively. Negative words concerning STAP cells began to appear on Twitter by February 9-15, 2014, or 3 weeks after Obokata presented a paper on STAP cells. The number of negative words in newspaper articles gradually increased beginning in the week of March 12-18, 2014. A total of 1000 tweets were randomly selected, and they were found to contain STAP-related opinions (43.3%, 433/1000), links to news sites and other sources (41.4%, 414/1000), false scientific or medical claims (8.9%, 89/1000), and topics unrelated to STAP (6.4%, 64/1000).

Focusing on research collaboration, this paper utilizes a unique dataset to investigate factors contributing to retraction probability and elapsed time between publication and retraction. Data analysis reveals that the majority of retracted papers are multi-authored and that repeat offenders are collaboration prone. Yet, all things being equal, collaboration, in and of itself, does not increase the likelihood of producing flawed or fraudulent research, at least in the form of retraction. That holds for all retractions and also retractions due to falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism (FFP). The research also finds that publications with authors from elite universities are less likely to be retracted, which is particularly true for retractions due to FFP. China stands out with the fastest retracting speed compared to other countries.

Although retractions are rare (only 1 in 5,000 of all publications), the data and the science propounded by the retracted papers have significant impact because many retracted papers are published in high impact journals and are highly cited by other scientists. The scientific data contained in a retracted paper should be erased from the data bank. Even after retraction, many of these papers continue to be cited or can re-appear in future literature citation after a number of years. Recent analysis shows that in the fields of life science and medicine, 67.4% of the retracted papers are due to misconduct, of which 43.4% are due to fraud or suspected fraud. These flawed papers have high impact on public health and patient care as illustrated here by the cases of Wakefield and Potti. It is suggested here that a more stringent process of publication is necessary, including the review process and author certification of responsible citations of the literature that does not contain retractions.

Unlike an expression of concern (EoC), erratum or corrigendum, a retraction will usually result in a rudimentary vestige of the work. Thus, any retraction notice that does not fully indicate a set of elements related to the reason and background for the retraction serves as a poor historical document. Moreover, poorly or incompletely worded retraction notices in fact do not serve their intended purpose, i.e., to hold all parties accountable, and to inform the scientific and wider public of the problem and reason for the paper's demise. This paper takes a look at the definitions and the policies of clauses for retractions, EoCs, errata and corrigenda in place by 15 leading science, technology and medicine (STM) publishers and four publishing-related bodies that we believe have the greatest influence on the current fields of science, technology and medicine. The primary purpose was to assess whether there is a consistency among these entities and publishers. Using an arbitrary 5-scale classification system, and evaluating the different categories of policies separately, we discovered that in almost all cases (88.9\\textbackslashudot%), the wording used to define these four categories of polices differs from that of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), which is generally considered to be the guiding set of definitions in science publishing. In addition, as much as 61\\textbackslashudot% deviation in policies (wording and meaning), relative to COPE guidelines, was discovered. When considering the average pooled deviation across all categories of policies, we discovered that there was either no deviation or a small deviation, only in the wording, in the definition of policies when compared to the COPE guidelines in 1 out of 3 ethical bodies, and in 40\\textbackslashudot% (6 out of 15) STM publishers. Moderate deviation from the COPE guidelines was detected in 26.7\\textbackslashudot% of STM publishers and one ethical body but a large deviation in one ethical body and 20\\textbackslashudot% of STM publishers was observed. Two STM publishers (13.3\\textbackslashudot%) did not report any information about these policies. Even though in practice, editors and publishers may deviate from these written definitions when dealing with case-by-case issues, we believe that it is essential, to serve as a consistent guide for authors and editors, that the wording be standardized across these entities. COPE and these entities also have the responsibility of making it clear that these definitions are merely suggestions and that their application may be subjected to subjective interpretation and application", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1007/s11948-016-9769-y", "Keywords": "Corrections\nError\nRetraction Policies", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Teixeira da Silva Jaime A, and Dobr\u00e1nszki Judit (2017) Notices and policies for retractions, expressions of concern, errata and corrigenda: their importance, content, and context.

Objective: To analyse the number of errata and retractions related to papers published by authors with Hungarian affiliations compared to those by authors with affiliations in the 34 other countries. Methods: Errata and retractions retrieved from three databases, namely Retraction Watch, Web of Science (WoS), and Scopus, were counted and sorted by country. Results: Scopus featured 7 retractions linked to Hungarian affiliations and WoS featured 10. Retraction Watch featured 26 such retractions, placing Hungary in 23rd position among the 35 countries arranged in descending order of the number of retractions. Of the 26 retractions from Hungary, 5 were in Elsevier journals and another 5 in Springer Nature; also, 8 of the 26 were associated with the University of Debrecen. When ranked for the number of errata notices for every 1000 published papers, Hungary was ranked 29th in WoS (2.54 notices per 1000 papers) and 26th in Scopus (2.3 notices per 1000 papers). Conclusions: The low numbers of Hungarian affiliations suggest that either research ethics are more stringently observed in Hungary or that publications from Hungarian research institutes, including papers in Hungarian &ndash; many Hungarian journals are indexed neither in WoS nor in Scopus &ndash; have not been scrutinized adequately through post-publication peer review.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.3897/ese.2021.e60203", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Teixeira da Silva Jaime A, and Erfanmanesh Mohammadamin (2021) Errata and retractions associated with research papers published by authors with Hungarian affiliations.

All rights reserved.Objective: Publications are retracted for many reasons, but the continued use and citation of retracted publications presents a problem for future research. This study investigated retractions in the dental literature to understand the characteristics of retracted publications, the reasons for their retractions, and the nature and context of their citations after retraction. Methods: In September 2018, the authors identified retracted dentistry publications using the Retraction Watch database. Citations to those publications were retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science. Characteristics of retracted publications and their citations were collected, including study design, reasons for retraction, and nature of citation (positive, negative, or neutral). We used chi-square tests to determine if there were notable differences between retracted publications that were cited following retraction and those that were not, and if there were relationships between the nature of the citation, the study design of the original publication, and its reason for retraction. Results: Of the 136 retracted publications, 84 were cited after retraction. When restricted to English language, 81 retracted publications received citations from 685 publications. Only 5.4% of the citations noted the retracted status of the original publication, while 25.3% of citations were neutral and 69.3% were positive. Animal studies were more likely to be uncited after retraction, while in vitro studies and randomized controlled trials were more likely to be cited. Retracted publications that were cited negatively were more likely to have been retracted due to scientific distortion than those that were cited positively or neutrally. Retracted publications that were cited negatively were also more likely to be observational studies than those cited positively or neutrally. Conclusion: Retracted publications in dentistry are continually cited positively following their retraction, regardless of their study designs or reasons for retraction. This indicates that the continued citation of retracted publications in this field cannot be isolated to certain research methods or misconduct but is, instead, a more widespread issue.", "Comments": "Export Date: 28 January 2021", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.5195/jmla.2020.824", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Theis-Mahon Nicole R, and Bakker Caitlin J (2020) The continued citation of retracted publications in dentistry.

To do so I look at retractions within management studies, analyse the reasons provided for them, and consider what they imply about the overall state of our research. I also draw on interview data from four editors who had retracted papers, and two co-authors of papers retracted because of fraud perpetrated by another author. To encourage candour, the confidentiality of the editors and co-authors has been maintained. This was important because if the editors\u2019 identities were known, so would the retractions they discuss, and authors\u2019 identities would then be revealed. This could raise legal issues, and would certainly have inhibited the interviewees. Co-authors had similar concerns. In addition, I interviewed a former academic guilty of research fraud. He is Diederik Stapel, mentioned briefly in Chapter 4. His fifty-eight retractions include three in management journals.

Study Design and Setting: We selected articles retracted due to allegations of falsification in January 1, 1980 to March 1, 2006 from journals with impact factor > 10 and > 30,000 annual citations. We evaluated characteristics of these papers and misconduct-involved authors and assessed whether they correlated with time to retraction. We also compared retracted articles vs. matched nonretracted articles in the same journals. Results: Fourteen eligible journals had 63 eligible retracted articles. Median time from publication to retraction was 28 months; it was 79 months for articles where a senior researcher was implicated in the misconduct vs. 22 months when junior researchers were implicated (log-rank P < 0.001). For the 25 implicated authors, the median time from the first publication of a fraudulent paper to the first retraction was 34 months, again with a clear difference according to researcher rank (log-rank P = 0.001). Retracted articles didn't differ from matched nonretracted papers in citations received within 12 months, number of authors, country, funding, or field, but were twofold more likely to have multinational authorship (P = 0.049). Conclusions: Retractions due to falsification can take a long time, especially when senior researchers are implicated. Fraudulent articles are not obviously distinguishable from nonfraudulent ones.

It is therefore important to have a process for identifying these post-publication changes in the source literature and then taking appropriate action, so that the systematic review reflects the status of the current literature.\n\nObjectives: To identify the most appropriate actions required when fraud or misconduct are identified in studies included in a Cochrane Review (CR).\n\nMethods: We recently set up a database and have started to collect the details of cases of scientific fraud and misconduct that have been brought to the attention of the Cochrane Editorial Unit. We recorded how the fraud/misconduct was identified, which details were added to the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS), and what action was taken to update the CR.\n\nResults: Action in response to cases of scientific fraud/misconduct was generally taken after the publication of a retraction notice. It remains a challenge to identify post-publication changes, especially corrections and expressions of concern. The database of previous cases has been used to draft a Cochrane policy on fraud and misconduct, which will provide consistent processes for dealing with instances of fraud/misconduct in the future.\n\nConclusions: The establishment of a database of cases of scientific fraud/misconduct has been instrumental to the drafting of a Cochrane policy on dealing with scientific fraud and misconduct. The policy will standardise the decisions that need to be taken when fraud or misconduct is confirmed or suspected in studies included in Cochrane Reviews. Future work will include establishing a defined process for identifying and recording post-publication changes to studies, and will aim to establish the steps that can be taken to identify doubtful studies before their inclusion in a CR.", "Comments": "abstract only", "ParentAuthors": "", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Urquhart B, MacLehose H, and Foxlee R (2017) A database to record the impact of fraud and misconduct in studies included in systematic reviews.

This very often means that the results it reports are flawed. Several authors have voiced concerns about the presence of retracted research in the memory of science. In particular, a retracted result is propagated by citing it. In the published literature, many instances are given of retracted articles that are cited both before and after their retraction. Even worse is the possibility that these articles in turn are cited in such a way that the retracted result is propagated further. METHODS: We have conducted a case study to find out how a retracted article is cited and whether retracted results are propagated through indirect citations. We have constructed the entire citation network for this case. RESULTS: We show that directly citing articles is an important source of propagation of retracted research results. In contrast, in our case study, indirect citations do not contribute to the propagation of the retracted result. CONCLUSIONS: While admitting the limitations of a study involving a single case, we think there are reasons for the non-contribution of indirect citations that hold beyond our case study.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-016-0008-5", "Keywords": "Case studies\nError propagation\nCitation of retracted papers\nMentions analysis\nCitation context analysis and retracted/corrected papers\nCitation context analysis", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "van der Vet Paul E, and Nijveen Harm (2016) Propagation of errors in citation networks: A study involving the entire citation network of a widely cited paper published in, and later retracted from, the journal Nature.

Cell line misidentification is a common problem that can be detected by authentication testing; however, misidentified cell lines continue to be used in publications. Here we explore the impact of one misidentified cell line, KB (HeLa), on the scientific literature. We identified 574 articles between 2000 and 2014 that provided an incorrect attribution for KB, in accordance with its false identity as oral epidermoid carcinoma, but only 57 articles that provided a correct attribution for KB, as HeLa or cervical adenocarcinoma. Statistical analysis of 57 correct and 171 incorrect articles showed that the number of citations to these articles increased over time. Content analysis of 200 citing articles showed there was a tendency to describe the cell line in accordance with the description in the cited paper. Analysis of journal impact factor showed no significant difference between correct and incorrect groups. Articles using KB or citing that usage were most frequently published in the subject areas of pharmacology, pharmacy, oncology, and medicinal chemistry.

METHODS: We searched PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), and Google Scholar to identify EEoCs issued for publications in PubMed and PMC up to 22 August 2016. We also searched the archives of the Retraction Watch blog, some journal and publisher websites, and studies of EEoCs. In addition, we searched for retractions of EEoCs and affected articles in PubMed up to 8 December 2016. We analyzed overall historical trends, as well as reported reasons and subsequent editorial actions related to EEoCs issued between August 2014 and August 2016. RESULTS: After screening 5,076 records, we identified 230 EEoCs that affect 300 publications indexed in PubMed, the earliest issued in 1985. Half of the primary EEoCs were issued between 2014 and 2016 (52%). We found evidence of some EEoCs that had been removed by the publisher without leaving a record and some were not submitted for PubMed or PMC indexing. A minority of publications affected by EEoCs had been retracted by early December 2016 (25%). For the subset of 92 EEoCs issued between August 2014 and August 2016, affecting 99 publications, the rate of retraction was similar (29%). The majority of EEoCs were issued because of concerns with validity of data, methods, or interpretation of the publication (68%), and 31% of cases remained open. Issues with images were raised in 40% of affected publications. Ongoing monitoring after the study identified another 17 EEoCs to year's end in 2016, increasing the number of EEoCs to 247 and publications in PubMed known to be affected by EEoCs to 320 at the end of 2016. CONCLUSIONS: EEoCs have been rare publishing events in the biomedical literature, but their use has been increasing. Most have not led to retractions, and many remain unresolved. Lack of prominence and inconsistencies in management of EEoCs reduce the ability of these notices to alert the scientific community to potentially serious problems in publications. EEoCs will be made identifiable in PubMed in 2017.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-017-0030-2", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Vaught Melissa, Jordan Diana C, and Bastian Hilda (2017) Concern noted: A descriptive study of editorial expressions of concern in PubMed and PubMed Central.

Methods We retrieved all available Medline retractions from 2005 to 2008 and a one-in-three random selection of those from 1988 to 2004. This yielded 312 retractions (from a total of 870). Details of the retraction including the reason for retraction were recorded by two investigators. Results Medline retractions have increased sharply since 1980 and currently represent 0.02% of included articles. Retractions were issued by authors (63%), editors (21%), journals (6%), publishers (2%) and institutions (1%). Reasons for retraction included honest error or non-replicable findings (40%), research misconduct (28%), redundant publication (17%) and unstated/ unclear (5%). Some of the stated reasons might have been addressed by corrections. Conclusions Journals' retraction practices are not uniform. Some retractions fail to state the reason, and therefore fail to distinguish error from misconduct.

At the same time, there are concerns about an increasing rate of pathologies in science. The growth of team science suggests the need to look beyond individual-level explanations and focus on organizational structures and institutional contexts to explain pathologies in science. Drawing on the literature on organizational pathologies, we argue that division of labor may be a key factor contributing to pathologies in science. Furthermore, we examine the effects of high-stakes incentives and of institutional corruption as additional predictors of scientific pathologies. Using retractions as an indicator of pathologies, and drawing on a matched sample of 195 retracted papers and 349 paired papers that were not retracted, we develop indicators of the division of labor in the team that produced a paper and find that the rate of retractions is higher as the division of labor increases (net of team size).

The aim of our review was to assess the chronologic trend, reasons, research type/design, and country of origin of retracted neurosurgical publications. METHODS: Three independent reviewers searched the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases using neurosurgical keywords for retracted articles from 1995 to 2016. Archives of retracted articles (retractionwatch.com) and the independent Web sites of neurosurgical journals were also searched. Data including the journal, impact factor, reason for retraction, country of origin, and citations were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 97 studies were included for data extraction. Journal impact factor ranged from 0.57 to 35.03. Most studies (61) were retracted within the last 5 years. The most common reason for retraction was because of a duplicated publication found elsewhere (26), followed closely by plagiarism (22), or presenting fraudulent data (14). Other reasons included scientific errors/mistakes, author misattribution, and compromised peer review. Articles originated from several countries and some were widely cited. CONCLUSIONS: Retractions of neurosurgical publications are increasing significantly, mostly because of issues of academic integrity, including duplicate publishing and plagiarism.

Many of these retractions are due to a faked review process and a large percentage of the retractions come from Chinese authors. The purpose of the current study was to determine the characteristics of retracted articles from 2012 to 2018 using the Medline database. Methods: The Medline database was searched to identify retracted publications from the year 2012 through 2017. Reasons for retraction were collected through PubMed, the Google search engine, and journal websites. Relevant data was collected for each retracted article and included the time from publication to retraction, the study type, the journal impact factor, and the institute of origin. Trends in characteristics related to retraction were determined. Results: Data from 4,043 retracted studies were included in the analysis. The most common reasons for retraction were fraud/suspected fraud (993), error (911), plagiarism (554), duplicate publication (547), and invalid peer review (384). The largest number of retracted articles was from China. Other countries with a large number of retractions were USA, Japan, India, Iran, Korea, Germany, and Italy. A faked review process, was responsible for a large number of retractions from China and Iran and from several journals.

METHODS: Computerized searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Ovid EMBASE and The Cochrane Library through to May 2017 looking for retracted studies using the terms 'retraction note', 'retracted note', 'withdrawn' and 'radiotherapy', 'radiation oncology'. Additional studies were identified by hand-searching 10 discipline-specific journals. Two authors independently screened papers, and then extracted author demographics, journal characteristics and retraction-specific variables. RESULTS: Of the 58 studies identified, the most common reason for retraction was misconduct (43%), methodological error (21%), authorship issues (5%), unknown causes (5%) and journal (administrative) errors (3%). A total of 13 systematic reviews or protocols (22%) were withdrawn from The Cochrane Library for being out-of-date or redundant. All but one retracted study and retraction notice was available in portable document format respectively. Of the 57 retrieved papers, 79% were identified as retracted via in-text notations or watermarks. Overall median time to retraction was 44 months (interquartile range [IQR] 11 to 98). However, 42 studies (72%) were still cited after retraction notices were published. CONCLUSION: A retracted study within the field of radiation oncology remains a relatively uncommon event. Although promising, our data suggest that the majority of these retracted articles continue to be cited as valid research. As such, there is still a need for clinicians to remain vigilant with their academic rigor and good clinical research practices. There is an urgent need for publication houses to foster universal publishing standards along with discipline-specific retraction guidelines.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2018.06.028 ", "Keywords": "Duplicate Publication as Topic\r\nPublications ethics\r\nRadiation Oncology\r\nRadiotherapy\r\nRetraction of Publication as Topic\r\nScientific Misconduct", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Wasiak Jason, Hamilton Daniel George, Foroudi Farshad, and Faggion Cl\u00f3vis Mariano Jr (2018) Surveying retracted studies and notices within the field of radiation oncology.

Slutsky, MD, to a set of control articles. The number of non-self-citations received by each article during each calendar year (1979 through 1990) was counted. The citation numbers were transformed into scores. Each Slutsky article was assigned a score between 1 and 3 based on the number of citations received by the Slutsky article and each of its assigned control articles. Average citation numbers and scores were tracked for each year during the 11-year study period.\r\rResults.  \u2014Before Slutsky's work was publicly questioned (1975 to 1985), scientists cited his articles as frequently as they cited control articles. After Slutsky's work was questioned and reports were published in the news media (1985), scientists cited his articles less frequently than they cited control articles. Citations decreased further after the University of California\u2014San Diego published a review of the validity of Slutsky's work in 1987. Citations did not decrease after the appearance of retractions in print or in MEDLINE.\r\rConclusion.  \u2014Scientists do not, and probably cannot, identify published articles that are fraudulent. However, when alerted to the presence of fraudulent results in the literature, the scientific community responds by reducing the number of citations of the tainted articles.

In anesthesiology, two high-profile cases of research fraud/unethical publishing have previously been identified. This study evaluated whether anesthesiology textbooks in German include controversial recommendations on hydroxyethyl starch (HES) and whether authors had undisclosed COI. Methods: Forty-five anesthesiology, critical care, and emergency medicine electronic textbooks (January 2015\u2013August 2017) were identified on the websites of German, Austrian, and Swiss publishers. Six textbooks were excluded (irrelevant content; compilation of peer-reviewed articles). Content on HES (\u2018Kolloid\u2019, \u2018Hydroxy\u00e4thylst\u00e4rke\u2019, \u2018Hydroxyethylst\u00e4rke\u2019, \u2018HES\u2019, \u2018HAES\u2019) and COI (\u2018Interessenkonflikt\u2018) was electronically searched; subject lists were manually searched. Recommendations on HES were analyzed in the context of indications/warnings/international guidelines. Potential COI for authors of controversial recommendations were searched on PubMed/EMBASE (January 2016\u2013May 2018). Results: COI statements were absent in 38/39 textbooks (present for 1/553 authors; 0.2 %). Twelve textbooks did not discuss HES for volume resuscitation. HES was recommended in 13 textbooks; many recommendations were controversial (10/39 textbooks, 26 %; 25/553 authors, 5 %). Journal COI statements were available for 18/25 authors; 7 authors had financial/other COI, including 4/18 (22 %) with ties to HES manufacturers. Conclusions: Recommendations on volume resuscitation with HES are highly controversial in German-language electronic textbooks; about one-quarter of relevant textbooks are inconsistent with regulatory authority or international guideline criteria. Undisclosed potential COI of textbook authors making controversial recommendations of HES were frequent, linking roughly one in five authors to the HES-producing industry.

The secondary objective was to investigate factors associated with misconduct retractions. DESIGN: A systematic, controlled, retrospective, bibliometric study. DATA SOURCE: Retracted publications dataset in the MEDLINE database. DATA SELECTION: PubMed was searched (Limits: English, human, January 1966 - February 2008) to identify publications retracted because of misconduct. Publications retracted because of mistake served as the control group. Standardized definitions and data collection tools were used, and data were analyzed by an independent academic statistician. RESULTS: Of the 463 retracted publications retrieved, 213 (46%) were retracted because of misconduct. Publications retracted because of misconduct rarely involved declared medical writers (3/213; 1.4%) or declared pharmaceutical industry support (8/213; 3.8%); no misconduct retractions involved both declared medical writers and the industry. Retraction because of misconduct, rather than mistake, was significantly associated with: absence of declared medical writers (odds ratio: 0.16; 95% confidence interval: 0.05-0.57); absence of declared industry involvement (0.25; 0.11-0.58); single authorship (2.04; 1.01-4.12); first author having at least one other retraction (2.05; 1.35-3.11); and first author affiliated with a low/middle income country (2.34; 1.18-4.63). The main limitations of this study were restricting the search to English-language and human research articles. CONCLUSIONS: Publications retracted because of misconduct rarely involved declared medical writers or declared pharmaceutical industry support.

The effect of retraction was studied by citation analysis of 53 retracted biomedical articles. Two research questions were investigated: Does publication of a retraction depress the frequency of subsequent citation? and Are post-retraction citations negative, or are retracted papers cited in order to support or substantiate the assumptions or findings of the citing article? The first question was studied by comparing the number of citations that each article received during the two years before retraction to the number of citations received during the two years following retraction. A statistically significant difference was found between the number of pre-retraction citations (495) and the number of post-retraction citations (303). The difference remained statistically significant even after estimating the decline in citation frequency attributable to obsolescence. The second question was studied by citation context analysis of the 303 residual articles that had cited the retracted publications. The portions of the citing articles that referenced the retracted articles were classified by a subject specialist according to the typology of citation contexts developed by Chubin and Moitra. Citation contexts were found to be affirmative to a statistically significant extent. With ninety percent of the citations being affirmative, the retracted articles were cited as though they were still valid. The citing articles, whose authors were evidently unaware of the published retractions, were written in standard scientific languages; generally originated in the United States, Western Europe, or Scandinavia; and were published in relatively prestigious journals. A content analysis of retraction statements indicated that only 68 percent specified the reason for retraction, 45 percent were published prominently in the journal, and 40 percent identified the individual responsible for the error or misconduct. The continued, affirmative use of retracted articles suggests that some retractions are going unheeded, and that invalid information may be perpetuated through citation in subsequent articles.", "Comments": "See Box: https://uofi.box.com/s/z57a10bs65e1x6ifflgoh3bs97a997vp", "ParentAuthors": "", "Keywords": "Citation context analysis and retracted/corrected papers\nCitation context analysis", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Wright Nancy Daniel (1991) A Citation Context Analysis of Retracted Scientific Articles. , College Park, MD, USA.", "type": "Publication", "Link": "https://www.proquest.com/openview/59a30828c20b9791a5b7023a8b4beaca/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y", "label": "A Citation Context Analysis of Retracted Scientific Articles", "author": ["Wright Nancy Daniel"], "id": 37275786, "pub-type": "Dissertation", "year": "1991", "Citation_context": "Citation--context explored", "Studies_related_to_discipline_or_geography": "Field-specific study (including systematic reviews)", "Processes_and_policies": "Analysis of reasons for retraction", "Characteristics_of_retraction_notices": "Retraction notices--assessment of quality (based on COPE compliance or other standards)", "Visibility_of_retraction_status": "Visibility/accessibility of retraction status/RETRACTION NOTICES", "Database_search_limitations": "Database source--construction of custom dataset", "Citation_of_retracted_papers": "Citation as focus--particular field of study", "Language": "English"}, {"Codes": [{"AttributeId": 9095044, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095066, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9095068, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}, {"AttributeId": 9564478, "AdditionalText": "", "ArmId": 0, "ArmTitle": "", "ItemAttributeFullTextDetails": []}], "Outcomes": [], "ShortTitle": "Wright (2011)", "DateCreated": "19/07/2018", "CreatedBy": "Jodi Schneider", "DateEdited": "25/06/2021", "EditedBy": "Katherine Howell", "Month": "April", "StandardNumber": "1536-5050 (Linking)", "City": "United States", "Country": "", "Publisher": "", "Institution": "", "Volume": "99", "Pages": "164-167.", "Edition": "", "Issue": "(2),", "Availability": "", "URL": "", "OldItemId": "21464856", "Abstract": "", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.3163/1536-5050.99.2.010 ", "Keywords": "*Databases, Bibliographic\r\nEditorial Policies\r\nMEDLINE\r\n*Periodicals as Topic\r\n*Retraction of Publication as Topic", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Wright Kath, and McDaid Catriona (2011) Reporting of article retractions in bibliographic databases and online journals.

This article reports a study conducted to identify RN textual features that can be used to disambiguate obscured authorship, ascertain the extent of authorship evasion in RNs from two disciplinary clusters, and determine if the disciplines varied in the distributions of different types of RN authorship. Drawing on a corpus of 370 RNs archived in the Web of Science for the hard discipline of Cell Biology and the soft disciplines of Business, Finance, and Management, this study has identified 25 types of textual markers that can be used to disambiguate authorship, and revealed that only 25.68% of the RNs could be unambiguously attributed to authors of the retracted articles alone or jointly and that authorship could not be determined for 28.92% of the RNs. Furthermore, the study has found marked disciplinary differences in the different categories of RN authorship.

It draws on a corpus of 255 RNs authored by two different groups of individuals (authors of retracted articles and journal authorities) and published in journals of two broad disciplinary groupings (hard and soft) indexed in the Web of Science (Core Collection). The analysis has identified 18 distinct move types, whose incidence varied widely from 1.57% to 100% of the RNs in the corpus. The employment of nine move types evidenced cross-disciplinary and/or authorship-based differences. The large number of move types found and their widely varying frequencies indicate that RNs as a high-stakes academic genre are still evolving and thus have not acquired a stable generic structure. The cross-disciplinary and authorship-related differences observed indicate that, like other genres, RNs are embedded in particular social contexts and are shaped by specific communicative purposes.", "Comments": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Id0MEAAAQBAJ", "ParentAuthors": "Lin Kathy Ling; Mwinlaaru Isaac N; Tay Dennis ; ", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.4324/9780429053351-8", "Keywords": "Language Arts & Disciplines / Communication Studies\r\nLanguage Arts & Disciplines / Linguistics / General", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Xu Shaoxiong Brian, and Hu Guangwei (2020) Retraction notices as a high-stakes academic genre: a move analysis.

The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of retractions and identify the reasons for retracted publications in the orthopaedic literature. Methods Two reviewers independently searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (1995 to current) using MeSH keyword headings and the 'retracted' filter. We also searched an independent website that reports and archives retracted scientific publications (www.retractionwatch.com). Two reviewers independently extracted data including reason for retraction, study type, journal impact factor, and country of origin. Results One hundred and ten retracted studies were included for data extraction. The retracted studies were published in journals with impact factors ranging from 0.000 (discontinued journals) to 13.262. In the 20-year search window, only 25 papers were retracted in the first ten years, with the remaining 85 papers retracted in the most recent decade. The most common reasons for retraction were fraudulent data (29), plagiarism (25) and duplicate publication (20). Retracted articles have been cited up to 165 times (median 6; interquartile range 2 to 19). Conclusion The rate of retractions in the orthopaedic literature is increasing, with the majority of retractions attributed to academic misconduct and fraud.

Current findings show that there is a growing number of retracted publications worldwide as well as in mainland China. Recidivist and large-scale centralized publication retractions have exerted numerous influences on the changes in the number of retracted publications. Countries with strong scientific research capabilities have more retracted publications. In addition, the number of retracted publications has significant differences corresponding to different disciplines. Specifically, life science is a typical field that the retraction of scientific publications frequently occurred, which can also be seen in partial interdisciplinary publications. In terms of journals, which are counted as small group but with a high ratio of retraction should be further investigated. The institutions with more publications retracted can be divided into three types: institutions with more and scattered disciplines, institutions with more but concentrated disciplines, and institutions with fewer and concentrated disciplines. Recidivists are the focus at the author level and have quite different specific behavioral patterns.

Search results showed that the proportion of international collaborations in retracted publications has fluctuated at around 20% in the past 17 years, and different collaboration patterns of major countries are revealed. The USA and China contributed to more than half of all retracted publications, while retraction rate of Chinese papers was three times higher compared to papers from the USA. A negative correlation between the proportion of internationally collaborative publications and the retraction rate was found. Countries involved in more international collaborations tend to have lower retraction rates. Also, the occurrences of plagiarism was found to be lower when a paper is contributed by more authors, while falsification or manipulation, errors or unreliable results appeared more frequently under the same condition. Conclusions are made with a focus on the need for more actions to strengthen the scientific norms and integrity within collaborative groups.", "Comments": "Export Date: 28 January 2021", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-020-03636-w", "Keywords": "Bibliometrics\r\nCoauthorship\r\nCollaboration\r\nRetracted publications\r\nScientific misconduct", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Zhang Qin, Abraham Juneman, and Fu Hui\u2011Zhen (2020) Collaboration and its influence on retraction based on retracted publications during 1978\u20132017.

We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and Retraction Watch databases for retractions and identified the following characteristics of each retracted article: publisher, open access status, impact factor of the journal that retracted the article, any PubPeer comments recorded before the retraction, status of the hospital where the authors worked, and any response to the retraction from the authors. We found 521 retractions, primarily by authors at grade A, third-level hospitals located in a limited number of regions of mainland China, and found that the journals that had published and later retracted the articles tended to have a medium to high impact factor. The main reasons for retraction were data manipulation, fabrication, or fraud; errors made by the authors; or plagiarism. Few of the retracted publications had PubPeer comments before their retraction. This is the first report to focus on retracted research coming out of hospitals in mainland China. The large number of retractions for Chinese hospitals is worrying. The results suggest that some retractions were related to third parties that provided editorial and other services.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.3138/jsp.52.2.03", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Zhao Tianye, Dai Tiancong, Lun Zhijun, and Gao Yanli (2021) An analysis of recently retracted articles by authors affiliated with hospitals in mainland China.

But in the absence of comprehensive and reliable data needed for analysis, formidable obstacles stand in the way of its being studied quantitively. Accessible databases, including government data, are flawed, while undertaking new data collection presents its own problems. First, little is known about biases in official government reports. Second, official reports exclude classes of malfeasance other than fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism of evidence (FFP). Third, while drawing on official data is expedient, available official information is thin; it tells little about miscreants and fails to identify potential causes of their actions and the environments in which misconduct occurred. Fourth, it also fails the test of permitting estimates to be made of populations at risk, making it impossible to calculate incidence. A healthy dose of skepticism is in order in evaluating both the findings of current quantitative studies and of proposals for remediation.", "Comments": "", "ParentAuthors": "", "DOI": "http://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00065", "Keywords": "", "ItemStatus": "I", "ItemStatusTooltip": "Included in review", "QuickCitation": "Zuckerman Harriet (2020) Is \u201cthe time ripe\u201d for quantitative research on misconduct in science?.
